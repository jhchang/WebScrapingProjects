,
,For the political term, see ,Benevolent dictatorship,.,
,Benevolent dictator for life, (,BDFL,) is a title given to a small number of ,open-source software development, leaders, typically project founders who retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community. The phrase originated in 1995 with reference to ,Guido van Rossum,, creator of the ,Python programming language,.,[1],[2], Shortly after Van Rossum joined the ,Corporation for National Research Initiatives,, the term appeared in a follow-up mail by ,Ken Manheimer, to a meeting trying to create a semi-formal group that would oversee Python development and workshops; this initial use included an additional joke of naming Van Rossum the ""First Interim BDFL"".,[1], Van Rossum announced on July 12, 2018, that he would be stepping down as BDFL of Python.,[3],
,BDFL should not be confused with the more common term for open-source leaders, ""benevolent dictator"", which was popularized by ,Eric S. Raymond,'s essay "",Homesteading the Noosphere,"" (1999).,[4], Among other topics related to ,hacker culture,, Raymond elaborates on how the nature of open source forces the ""dictatorship"" to keep itself benevolent, since a strong disagreement can lead to the ,forking, of the project under the rule of new leaders.

,  ,Rich Hickey in ,San Francisco,
,Rich Hickey, is a computer programmer and speaker, known as the creator of the ,Clojure, programming language. Clojure is a ,Lisp, dialect built on top of the ,Java Virtual Machine,.,[1],[2],[3],  He also created or designed ClojureScript, the ,Extensible Data Notation, (EDN) data format, and the ,Datomic, distributed database. He is the ,chief technology officer, at Cognitect.
,Before Clojure, he developed dotLisp, a similar project based on the ,.NET Framework,.,[4], Hickey is an independent software developer and a consultant with over 20 years of experience in many facets of software development. He has worked on scheduling systems, broadcast automation, audio analysis and fingerprinting, database design, yield management, exit poll systems, and machine listening.,[5],
,He spent about 2½ years working on Clojure before releasing it to the world, much of that time working exclusively on Clojure without external funding.

,Elm, is a ,domain-specific programming language, for ,declaratively, creating ,web browser,-based ,graphical user interfaces,. Elm is ,purely functional,, and is developed with emphasis on ,usability,, performance, and ,robustness,. It advertises ""no ,runtime, ,exceptions, in practice"",,[6], made possible by the Elm compiler's ,static type checking,.

,History,[,edit,],
,Elm was initially designed by Evan Czaplicki as his thesis in 2012.,[7], The first release of Elm came with many examples and an online editor that made it easy to try out in a ,web browser,.,[8], Evan Czaplicki joined ,Prezi, in 2013 to work on Elm,,[9], and in 2016 moved to ,NoRedInk, as an Open Source Engineer, also starting the Elm Software Foundation.,[10],
,The initial implementation of the Elm compiler targets ,HTML,, ,CSS,, and ,JavaScript,.,[11], The set of core tools has continued to expand, now including a ,REPL,,,[12], ,package manager,,,[13], time-traveling debugger,,[14], and installers for macOS and Windows.,[15], Elm also has an ecosystem of community created libraries,[16], and an advanced online editor that allows saved work and inclusion of community libraries.,[17],
,
,Features,[,edit,],
,Elm has a small but expressive set of language constructs, including traditional if-expressions, let-expressions for local state, and case-expressions for ,pattern matching,.,[18], As a functional language, it supports ,anonymous functions,, functions as arguments, and partial application (,currying,) by default. Its semantics include immutable values, ,stateless functions,, and static typing with type inference. Elm programs render HTML through a virtual DOM, and may interoperate with other code by using ""JavaScript as a service"".
,
,Immutability,[,edit,],
,All values in Elm are ,immutable,, meaning that a value cannot be modified after it is created. Elm uses ,persistent data structures, to implement its ,Array,, ,Dict,, and ,Set, libraries.,[19],
,
,Static types,[,edit,],
,Elm is statically typed. Type annotations are optional (due to type inference) but strongly encouraged. Annotations exist on the line above the definition (unlike C-family languages where types and names are interspersed). Elm uses a single colon to mean ""has type"".
,Types include primitives like integers and strings, and basic data structures such as lists, tuples, and records. Functions have types written with arrows, for example ,round : Float -> Int,. ,Custom types, allow the programmer to create custom types to represent data in a way that matches the problem domain.,[20],
,Types can refer to other types, for example a ,List Int,. Types are always capitalized; lowercase names are type variables. For example, a ,List a, is a list of values of unknown type. It is the type of the empty list and of the argument to ,List.length,, which is agnostic to the list's elements. There are a few special types that programmers create to interact with the Elm runtime. For example, ,Html Msg, represents a (virtual) DOM tree whose event handlers all produce messages of type ,Msg,.
,Rather than allow any value to be implicitly nullable (such a JavaScript's ,undefined, or a ,null pointer,), Elm's standard library defines a ,Maybe a, type. Code that produces or handles an optional value does so explicitly using this type, and all other code is guaranteed a value of the claimed type is actually present.
,
,Module system,[,edit,],
,Elm has a ,module system, that allows users to break their code into smaller parts called modules. Modules can hide implementation details such as helper functions, and group related code together. Modules serve as a namespace for imported code, such as ,Bitwise.and,. Third party libraries (or packages) consist of one or more modules, and are available from the ,Elm Public Library,. All libraries are versioned according to ,semver,, which is enforced by the compiler and other tools. That is, removing a function or changing its type can only be done in a major release.
,
,Interoperability with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,[,edit,],
,Elm uses an abstraction called ports to communicate with ,JavaScript,.,[21], It allows values to flow in and out of Elm programs, making it possible to communicate between Elm and JavaScript.
,Elm has a library called elm/html that a programmer can use to write HTML and CSS within Elm.,[22], It uses a virtual ,DOM, approach to make updates efficient.,[23],
,
,Backend,[,edit,],
,Elm does not officially support server-side development. The core development team does not consider it as their primary goal and prefers to focus development on the enhancement of front-end development experience.  Nevertheless, there are several independent projects, which attempt to explore possibilities to use Elm for the back-end. The projects are mainly stuck on Elm version 0.18.0 since newer ones do not support ""native"" code and some other utilized features. There are two attempts to use Elm with BEAM (Erlang virtual machine). One of the projects executes Elm directly on the environment,[24], while another one compiles it to Elixir.,[25], Also, there was an attempt to create a back-end framework for Elm powered by Node.js infrastructure.,[26], None of the projects are production-ready.
,
,Limitations,[,edit,],
,Elm does not support ,higher-kinded polymorphism,,,[27],, which related languages ,Haskell, and ,PureScript, offer in the form of ,type classes,. This means that, for example, Elm does not have a generic ,map, function which works across multiple data structures such as ,List, and ,Set,. In Elm, such functions are typically invoked qualified by their module name, for example calling ,List.map, and ,Set.map,. In Haskell or PureScript, there would be only one function ,map,. This is a known feature request that is on Czaplicki's rough roadmap, however. ,[28],

,Programming,[,edit,],
,In 1999, Hansson founded and built a Danish online gaming news website and community called Daily Rush, which he ran until 2001.,[4], After attracting the attention of ,Jason Fried, by offering him help with PHP coding, Hansson was hired by Fried to build a web-based ,project management, tool, which ultimately became 37signals' ,Basecamp, ,software as a service, product.,[5], To aid the development process, Hansson used the then-obscure Ruby programming language to develop a custom ,web framework,. He released the framework separately from the project management tool in 2004 as the ,open source, project ,Ruby on Rails,. In 2005, Hansson was recognized by ,Google, and ,O'Reilly, with the ""Hacker of the Year"" award for his creation of ,Ruby on Rails,.,[6], After graduating from the ,Copenhagen Business School, and receiving his ,bachelor's degree, in Computer Science and Business Administration, Hansson moved from ,Denmark, to ,Chicago, Illinois,, ,U.S., in November 2005.,[7],

,David Heinemeier Hansson lists photography and race car driving amongst his many hobbies.,[8], During the post-race technical checks, certain irregularities were detected on the Vaillante Rebellion team's #13 Oreca 07-Gibson, resulting in the car's disqualification from the 2017 24 Hours of Le Mans. He took part in the ,2012 24 Hours of Le Mans, driving for ,OAK Racing,.,[9], He also drove a Morgan-Nissan P2 car for ,Conquest Racing, in the ,American Le Mans Series, (ALMS), winning two races in the season. Heinemeier Hansson joined OAK Racing full-time in 2013, taking five 2nd-place finishes to finish 2nd in the Trophy for LMP2 Drivers. In July 2010 it was revealed that Heinemeier Hansson was the person that had commissioned the one-off ,Pagani Zonda HH, supercar.,[10], He also owns the one-off ,Koenigsegg Agera, HH car.,[11],

,Ethereum, is the second largest ,cryptocurrency, platform by ,market capitalization,, behind ,Bitcoin,.,[1],[2], It is a decentralized ,open source, ,blockchain, featuring ,smart contract, functionality. ,Ether, is the cryptocurrency generated by Ethereum ,miners, as a reward for computations performed to secure the blockchain.,[3], Ethereum serves as the platform for over 260,000 different cryptocurrencies, including 47 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.,[4],[5],
,Ethereum provides a decentralized ,virtual machine,, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes.,[6], The virtual machine's ,instruction set,, in contrast to others like ,Bitcoin, ,Script,, is ,Turing-complete,. ""Gas"", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate ,spam, and allocate resources on the network.,[6],
,Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by ,Vitalik Buterin,, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Development was funded by an online ,crowdsale, that took place between July and August 2014.,[6], The system then went live on 30 July 2015, with 72 million coins minted.,[7],[8], This accounts for about 65 percent of the total circulating supply in April 2020.,[9],[10],[,non-primary source needed,],
,In 2016, as a result of an exploitation of a flaw in ,The DAO, project's ,smart contract, software, and subsequent theft of $50 million worth of ether,,[11], Ethereum was split into two separate blockchains. The new separate version became Ethereum (ETH) with the theft reversed,,[12], and the original chain continued as ,Ethereum Classic (ETC),.,[13],
,Ethereum is currently developing and planning to implement a series of upgrades called Ethereum 2.0.,[14], Current specifications for Ethereum 2.0 include a transition to ,proof of stake, and an increase in transaction throughput using ,sharding, technology.,[15],[16],

,Etymology,[,edit,],
,Vitalik Buterin picked the name Ethereum after browsing ,Wikipedia, articles about elements and science fiction, when he found the name, noting, ""I immediately realized that I liked it better than all of the other alternatives that I had seen; I suppose it was the fact that [it] sounded nice and it had the word ',ether,', referring to the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel."",[17],
,
,History,[,edit,],
,Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by ,Vitalik Buterin,,,[18], a programmer and co-founder of ,Bitcoin Magazine,, in late 2013 with a goal of building decentralized applications.,[19],[20], Buterin had argued that Bitcoin needed a ,scripting language, for application development. Failing to gain agreement, he proposed the development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.,[6],:,88,
,Ethereum was announced at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, in January 2014.,[17], During the same time as the conference, a group of people rented a house in Miami: ,Gavin Wood,, ,Charles Hoskinson,, and Anthony Di Iorio, a Torontonian who financed the project.,[17], Di Iorio invited friend ,Joseph Lubin,, who invited reporter Morgen Peck, to bear witness.,[17], Six months later the founders met again in a house in ,Zug,, Switzerland, where Buterin told the founders that the project would proceed as a non-profit. Hoskinson left the project at that time.,[17],
,Ethereum has an unusually long list of founders. Anthony Di Iorio wrote ""Ethereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin, Myself, Charles Hoskinson, Mihai Alisie, & Amir Chetrit (the initial 5) in December 2013. Joseph Lubin, Gavin Wood, & Jeffrey Wilke were added in early 2014 as founders."" Formal development of the Ethereum software project began in early 2014 through a ,Swiss, company, ,Ethereum Switzerland GmbH, (,EthSuisse,).,[21],[22],
The basic idea of putting executable smart contracts in the blockchain needed to be specified before the software could be implemented; this work was done by Gavin Wood, then ,chief technology officer,, in the ,Ethereum Yellow Paper, that specified the Ethereum Virtual Machine.,[23],
Subsequently, a Swiss non-profit foundation, the ,Ethereum Foundation, (,Stiftung Ethereum,), was created as well. Development was funded by an online public ,crowdsale, during July–August 2014, with the participants buying the Ethereum value token (ether) with another digital currency, ,Bitcoin,.
,While there was early praise for the technical innovations of Ethereum, questions were also raised about its security and scalability.,[19],
,In 2019, an Ethereum foundation employee named ,Virgil Griffith, was arrested by the US government for presenting at a blockchain conference in North Korea.,[24],
,
,Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA),[,edit,],
,In March 2017, various blockchain start-ups, research groups, and Fortune 500 companies announced the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) with 30 founding members.,[25], By May, the nonprofit organization had 116 enterprise members—including ,ConsenSys,, ,CME Group,, ,Cornell University's research group,, ,Toyota Research Institute,, ,Samsung SDS,, ,Microsoft,, ,Intel,, ,J. P. Morgan,, ,Cooley LLP,, ,Merck KGaA,, ,DTCC,, ,Deloitte,, ,Accenture,, ,Banco Santander,, ,BNY Mellon,, ,ING,, and ,National Bank of Canada,.,[26],[27],[28], By July 2017, there were over 150 members in the alliance, including recent additions ,MasterCard,, ,Cisco Systems,, ,Sberbank, and ,Scotiabank,.,[29],[30],

,Several codenamed prototypes of the Ethereum platform were developed by the Ethereum Foundation, as part of their Proof-of-Concept series, prior to the official launch of the Frontier network. ""Olympic"" was the last of these prototypes, and public beta pre-release. The Olympic network provided users with a ,bug bounty, of 25,000 Ether for stress testing the limits of the Ethereum blockchain. ""Frontier"" marked the tentative experimental release of the Ethereum platform in July 2015.,[31],
,Since the initial launch, Ethereum has undergone several planned protocol upgrades, which are important changes affecting the underlying functionality and/or ,incentive structures, of the platform.,[32],[,non-primary source needed,],
,Protocol upgrades are accomplished by means of a ,hard fork,.
,
,Difficulty Bomb and The Ice Age,[,edit,],
,The Ethereum Difficulty bomb is the difficulty of the blockchain mining algorithm puzzle which began increasing in November 2016, from block 200,000. The onset of the Difficulty Bomb is referred to as Ethereum's Ice Age, as the Ethereum network started the transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). A difficulty bomb was scheduled in February 2019 but was pushed back by developers.,[33],
,
,The DAO event,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,The DAO (organization),
,In 2016 a ,decentralized autonomous organization, called ,The DAO,, a set of ,smart contracts, developed on the platform, raised a record ,US$150 million, in a ,crowdsale, to fund the project.,[34], The DAO was exploited in June when ,US$50 million, in Ether were taken by an unknown hacker.,[35],[36], The event sparked a debate in the crypto-community about whether Ethereum should perform a contentious ""hard fork"" to reappropriate the affected funds.,[37], As a result of the dispute, the network split in two. Ethereum (the subject of this article) continued on the forked blockchain, while ,Ethereum Classic, continued on the original blockchain.,[38], The hard fork created a rivalry between the two networks.
,After the hard fork related to The DAO, Ethereum subsequently forked twice in the fourth quarter of 2016 to deal with other attacks. By the end of November 2016, Ethereum had increased its ,DDoS, protection, de-bloated the blockchain, and thwarted further spam attacks by hackers.,[,unbalanced opinion?,],[,citation needed,],
,
,Ethereum 2.0,[,edit,],
,Development is underway for a major upgrade to the Ethereum platform, known as Ethereum 2.0.
,The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade (also known as Serenity) is designed to be launched in three phases: 
,
,""Phase 0"" will create the Beacon Chain, a ,proof-of-stake, blockchain that will serve as the backbone of Ethereum 2.0,
,""Phase 1"" will create ,shard, chains and connect them to the Beacon Chain,
,""Phase 2"" will implement state execution in the shard chains.,[39], The current Ethereum 1.0 chain is expected to become one of the shards of Ethereum 2.0.,
,Ethereum 2.0 has five main design goals:
,
,Minimize complexity by simplifying the Ethereum blockchain, even at the cost of efficiency.,
,Improve up-time and keep the Ethereum network live during major network splits.,
,Ensure longevity by building Ethereum 2.0 with elements which are either quantum secure or can be easily swapped out for quantum secure replacements when available.,
,Increase security by using design techniques which allow a large number of validators to secure the network by staking their ETH holdings.,
,Reduce barriers to entry, making it possible for a typical laptop to process or validate shards.,[40],
,Characteristics,[,edit,],
,Further information: ,Cryptocurrency,
,As with other cryptocurrencies, the validity of each Ether is provided by a ,blockchain,, which is a continuously growing list of ,records,, called ,blocks,, which are linked and secured using ,cryptography,.,[41],[42], By design, the blockchain is inherently resistant to modification of the data. It is an open, ,distributed ledger, that records transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.,[43], Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum operates using accounts and balances in a manner called state transitions. This does not rely upon ,unspent transaction outputs, (UTXOs). The state denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. The state is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate ,Merkle, Patricia tree. A ,cryptocurrency wallet, stores the ,public and private ""keys"", or ""addresses"" which can be used to receive or spend ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 ""HD Wallet"". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an Ether transaction.
,To send the Ethereum value token Ether to an account, you need the ,Keccak-256, hash of the public key of that account. Ethereum accounts are pseudonymous in that they are not linked to individual persons, but rather to one or more specific addresses.

,Ether, is a fundamental token for operation of Ethereum, which thereby provides a public ,distributed ledger, for transactions. It is used to pay for gas, a unit of computation used in transactions and other state transitions. Mistakenly, this currency is also referred to as ,Ethereum,.
,It is listed under the ,ticker symbol, ETH and traded on ,cryptocurrency, exchanges, and the ,Greek, ,uppercase Xi, character (Ξ) is generally used for its ,currency symbol,. It is also used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the Ethereum network.,[44],
,
,Addresses,[,edit,],
,Ethereum addresses are composed of the prefix ""0x"", a common identifier for ,hexadecimal,, concatenated with the rightmost 20 bytes of the ,Keccak-256, hash (,big endian,) of the ,ECDSA, ,public key, (the curve used is the so-called ,secp256k1,, the same as ,Bitcoin,). In hexadecimal, 2 digits represent a byte, meaning addresses contain 40 hexadecimal digits. An example of an Ethereum address is 0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268. Contract addresses are in the same format, however, they are determined by sender and creation transaction nonce.,[45], User accounts are indistinguishable from contract accounts given only an address for each and no blockchain data. Any valid Keccak-256 hash put into the described format is valid, even if it does not correspond to an account with a private key or a contract. This is unlike Bitcoin, which uses ,base58check, to ensure that addresses are properly typed.
,
,Comparison to bitcoin,[,edit,],
,Ethereum is different from ,Bitcoin, (the ,cryptocurrency, with the largest ,market capitalization, as of June 2018) in several aspects:
,
,Its ,block time, is 14 to 15 seconds, compared with 10 minutes for bitcoin.,
,Mining, of Ether generates new coins at a usually consistent rate, occasionally changing during hard forks, while for bitcoin the rate halves every 4 years.,
,For proof-of-work, it uses the ,Ethash, algorithm which reduces the advantage of specialized ,ASICs, in mining.,
,Transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use and storage needs (in a system known as gas), while bitcoin transactions compete by means of transaction size, in bytes.,
,Ethereum uses an accounting system where values in Wei (the smallest denomination of 1 Ether, 1 ETH = 10,18, Wei) are debited from accounts and credited to another, as opposed to Bitcoin's UTXO system, which is more analogous to spending cash and receiving change in return.,
,Supply,[,edit,],
,The total supply of Ether was around Ξ110.5 million as of 16 April 2020. In 2017, mining generated 9.2 million new ether, corresponding to a 10% increase in its total supply. Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG), which is a hybrid Proof of Work and Proof of Stake scheme, and Casper Correct-By-Construction (CBC), a separate Proof of Stake design of Casper, are expected to reduce the inflation rate to between 0.5% to 2%.,[,citation needed,], There is no currently implemented hard cap on the total supply of ETH.,[46],
,
,Markets and stores,[,edit,],
,Ether can be traded by regular currency ,brokers,, ,cryptocurrency exchanges,, as well as many online ,cryptocurrency wallets,.,[47],
,
,Platform,[,edit,],
,Virtual Machine,[,edit,],
,The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is a 256-bit register stack, designed to run the same code exactly as intended. It is the fundamental consensus mechanism for Ethereum. The formal definition of the EVM is specified in the Ethereum Yellow Paper.,[45],[48], Ethereum Virtual Machines have been implemented in ,C++,, ,C#,, ,Go,, ,Haskell,, ,Java,, ,JavaScript,, ,Python,, ,Ruby,, ,Rust,, ,Elixir,, ,Erlang,, and soon, ,WebAssembly, (currently under development).
,
,Smart contracts,[,edit,],
,Ethereum's ,smart contracts, are based on different computer languages, which developers use to program their own functionalities. Smart contracts are ,high-level, programming ,abstractions, that are compiled down to EVM ,bytecode, and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain for execution. They can be written in ,Solidity, (a language library with similarities to ,C, and ,JavaScript,), Serpent (similar to ,Python,, but deprecated), LLL (a ,low-level, ,Lisp,-like language), and Mutan (,Go,-based, but deprecated). There is also a research-oriented language under development called Vyper (a ,strongly-typed, ,Python,-derived ,decidable language,).
,Smart contracts can be public, which opens up the possibility to prove functionality, e.g. self-contained ,provably fair, casinos.,[49],
,One issue related to using smart contracts on a public blockchain is that bugs, including security holes, are visible to all but cannot be fixed quickly.,[50], One example of this is the 17 June 2016 attack on The DAO, which could not be quickly stopped or reversed.,[35],
,There is ongoing research on how to use formal verification to express and prove non-trivial properties. A ,Microsoft Research, report noted that writing solid smart contracts can be extremely difficult in practice, using The DAO hack to illustrate this problem. The report discussed tools that Microsoft had developed for verifying contracts, and noted that a large-scale analysis of published contracts is likely to uncover widespread vulnerabilities. The report also stated that it is possible to verify the equivalence of a Solidity program and the EVM code.,[51],
,
,Applications,[,edit,],
,Ethereum apps are written in one of seven different ,Turing-complete languages,.,[52], Developers use the language to create and publish applications which they know will run inside Ethereum. The ,stablecoins, ,Tether, and DAI ,[53],, and the ,prediction market, ,Augur, are examples of applications that run on Ethereum.,[54],[55],
,Many uses have been proposed for the Ethereum platform, including ones that are impossible or unfeasible.,[56],[44], Use case proposals have included finance, the ,internet-of-things,, ,farm-to-table, produce, ,electricity sourcing and pricing,, and ,sports betting,. Ethereum is (as of 2017) the leading ,blockchain, platform for ,initial coin offering, projects, with over 50% market share.,[57],
,
,Enterprise software,[,edit,],
,Ethereum-based customized software and networks, independent from the public Ethereum chain, are being tested by ,enterprise software, companies.,[58], Interested parties include ,Microsoft,, ,IBM,, ,JPMorgan Chase,,,[44], ,Deloitte,,,[59], ,R3,,,[60], ,Innovate UK, (cross-border payments prototype).,[61], Barclays, UBS and Credit Suisse are experimenting with Ethereum.
,
,Permissioned ledgers,[,edit,],
,Ethereum-based ,permissioned blockchain, variants are used and being investigated for various projects.
,
,J. P. Morgan Chase, is developing ,JPM Coin, on a permissioned-variant of Ethereum blockchain dubbed ""Quorum"".,[62], It's designed to toe the line between private and public in the realm of shuffling derivatives and payments. The idea is to satisfy regulators who need seamless access to financial goings-on, while protecting the privacy of parties that don't wish to reveal their identities nor the details of their transactions to the general public.,[63],
,Royal Bank of Scotland, has announced that it has built a Clearing and Settlement Mechanism (CSM) based on the Ethereum distributed ledger and smart contract platform.,[64],[65],
,Performance,[,edit,],
,In Ethereum all smart contracts are stored publicly on every node of the blockchain, which has costs.,[66], Being a ,blockchain, means it is ,secure by design,[,clarification needed,], and is an example of a distributed computing system with high ,Byzantine fault tolerance,. The downside is that performance issues arise in that every node is calculating all the smart contracts in real time, resulting in lower speeds.,[66], As of January 2016, the Ethereum protocol could process about 25 transactions per second.,[66], In comparison, the ,Visa, payment platform processes 45,000 payments per second leading some to question the scalability of Ethereum.,[67], On 19 December 2016, Ethereum exceeded one million transactions in a single day for the first time.,[68],
,Ethereum engineers have been working on ,sharding, the calculations, and the next step (called Ethereum 2) was presented at Ethereum's Devcon 3 in November 2017.,[69],
,Ethereum's blockchain uses ,Merkle trees,, for security reasons, to improve scalability, and to optimize transaction hashing.,[70], As with any Merkle tree implementation, it allows for storage savings, set membership proofs (called ""Merkle proofs""), and light client synchronization. The Ethereum network has at times faced congestion problems, for example, congestion occurred during late 2017 in relation to ,Cryptokitties,.,[71],
,
,Development governance and EIP,[,edit,],

,On social governance,
,Our governance is inherently social, people who are more connected in the community have more power, a kind of soft power.,
,Vlad Zamfir, Ethereum core developer, ,The New Yorker,[17],
,
,
,In October 2015,,[72], a development governance was proposed as ,Ethereum Improvement Proposal,, aka EIP, standardized on EIP-1.,[73], The core development group and community were to gain consensus by a process regulated EIP.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Criticisms,[,edit,],
,Izabella Kaminska, the editor of ,FT Alphaville,, pointed out in 2017 that criminals were using Ethereum to run ,Ponzi schemes, and other forms of investment fraud.,[74], The article was based on a paper from the ,University of Cagliari,, which placed the number of Ethereum smart contracts which facilitate Ponzi schemes at nearly 10% of 1384 smart contracts examined. However, it also estimated that only 0.05% of the transactions on the network were related to such contracts.,[75],

,Drupal,Drupal 8 in action. Showing in-context editing and previews (,WYSIWYG,).,Original author(s),Dries Buytaert,Developer(s),Drupal community,Initial release,January 15, 2001,; 19 years ago, (,2001-01-15,),[1],Stable release,9.0.1,[2],
   / 2020-06-17,[±],
,Repository,Drupal Repository,Written in,PHP,, using ,Symfony,Operating system,Unix-like,, ,Windows,Platform,Web platform,Size,80 MB (uncompressed Drupal 8 core),[3],Type,Content management framework,, ,content management system,, ,blog software,License,GPLv2+,[4],Website,www,.drupal,.org,
,Drupal, ,/,ˈ,d,r,uː,p,əl,/,[5], is a ,free and open-source, web ,content management framework, written in ,PHP, and distributed under the ,GNU General Public License,.,[4],[6],[7], Drupal provides a ,back-end, framework for at least 2.3% of all ,websites, worldwide,[8],[9], – ranging from personal ,blogs, to corporate, political, and government sites.,[10], Systems also use Drupal for ,knowledge management, and for business collaboration.,[11],
,As of December 2019,[update],, the Drupal community comprised more than 1.39 million members,,[12],[13], including 117,000 users actively contributing,,[14], resulting in more than 44,000 free modules that extend and customize Drupal functionality,,[15], over 2,800 free themes that change the look and feel of Drupal,,[16], and at least 1,300 free distributions that allow users to quickly and easily set up a complex, use-specific Drupal in fewer steps.,[17],
,The standard release of Drupal, known as ,Drupal core,, contains basic features common to ,content-management systems,. These include user account registration and maintenance, menu management, ,RSS, feeds, taxonomy, page layout customization, and system administration. The Drupal core installation can serve as a simple website, a single- or multi-user blog, an ,Internet forum,, or a community website providing for ,user-generated content,.
,Drupal also describes itself as a ,Web application framework,.,[18], When compared with notable frameworks Drupal meets most of the generally accepted ,feature requirements, for such web frameworks.,[19],[20],
,Although Drupal offers a sophisticated ,API, for developers, basic Web-site installation and administration of the framework require no programming skills.,[21],
,Drupal runs on any ,computing platform, that supports both a ,web server, capable of running PHP and a ,database, to store content and configuration.

,
,Originally written by ,Dries Buytaert, as a ,message board,, Drupal became an ,open source, project in 2001.,[24], The name ,Drupal, represents an English rendering of the ,Dutch, word ,druppel,, which means ""drop"" (as in a water droplet).,[25], The name came from the now-defunct Drop.org website, whose code slowly evolved into Drupal. Buytaert wanted to call the site ""dorp"" (Dutch for ""village"") for its community aspects, but mistyped it when checking the domain name and thought the error sounded better.,[24],
,Interest in Drupal got a significant boost in 2003 when it helped build ""DeanSpace"" for ,Howard Dean,, one of the candidates in the ,U.S. Democratic Party,'s primary campaign for the ,2004 U.S. presidential election,. DeanSpace used open-source sharing of Drupal to support a decentralized network of approximately 50 disparate, unofficial pro-Dean websites that allowed users to communicate directly with one another as well as with the campaign.,[26], After Dean ended his campaign, members of his Web team continued to pursue their interest in developing a Web platform that could aid political activism by launching CivicSpace Labs in July 2004, ""...the first company with full-time employees that was developing and distributing Drupal technology."",[27], Other companies began to also specialize in Drupal development.,[28],[29], By 2013 the Drupal website listed hundreds of vendors that offered Drupal-related services.,[30],
,As of 2014,[update], Drupal is developed by a community.,[31], From July 2007 to June 2008 the Drupal.org site provided more than 1.4 million downloads of Drupal software, an increase of approximately 125% from the previous year.,[32],[33],
,As of January 2017,[update], more than 1,180,000 sites use Drupal.,[34], These include hundreds of well-known organizations,,[35], including corporations, media and publishing companies, governments, non-profits,,[36], schools, and individuals. Drupal has won several ,Packt, Open Source CMS Awards,[37], and won the ,Webware 100,[,clarification needed,], three times in a row.,[38],[39],
,Drupal 6 was released on February 13, 2008,,[40], on March 5, 2009 Buytaert announced a ,code freeze, for Drupal 7 for September 1, 2009.,[41], Drupal 7 was released on January 5, 2011, with release parties in several countries.,[42], After that, maintenance on Drupal 5 stopped, with only Drupal 7 and Drupal 6 maintained.,[43], Drupal 7 series maintenance updates are released regularly.,[44], Drupal 7 is officially announced to reach end-of-life by 2021, official community support along with support provided by the Drupal Association on Drupal.org will cease by 2021.,[45],
,On October 7, 2015 Drupal 8 first release candidate (rc1) was announced.,[46], Drupal 8 includes new features and improvements for both users and developers, including: a revamped user interface; WYSIWYG and in-place editing; improved mobile support; added and improved key contributed modules including Views, Date, and Entity Reference; introduced a new object-oriented backend leveraging Symfony components; revamped configuration management; and improved multilingual support. Drupal 8 rc1 is the collective work of over 3,200 core contributors.,[47],
,Drupal 8.0.0 was released on November 19, 2015.,[48], Subsequent major and minor releases which bring numerous improvements and bug fixes (including CKEditor WYSIWYG enhancements, added APIs, an improved help page) can be found on the ,Releases, page.,[49],
,Drupal 9 initial release 9.0.0 was on June 3, 2020.,[50],
,
,Core,[,edit,],
,In the Drupal community, ""CORE"" refers to the collaboratively built codebase that can be extended through contributory modules and – for versions prior to Drupal 8 – is kept outside of the ""sites"" folder of a Drupal installation.,[51], (Starting with version 8, core is kept in its own 'core' sub-directory.) Drupal core is the stock element of Drupal. Common Drupal-specific libraries, as well as the bootstrap process, are defined as Drupal core; all other functionality is defined as Drupal modules including the system module itself.
,In a Drupal website's default configuration, authors can contribute content as either registered or anonymous users (at the discretion of the administrator). This content is accessible to web visitors through a variety of selectable criteria. As of Drupal 8, Drupal has adopted some ,Symfony, libraries into Drupal core.
,Core modules also includes a hierarchical ,taxonomy, system, which lets developers categorize content or ,tagged, with key words for easier access.,[21],
,Drupal maintains a detailed ,changelog, of core feature updates by version.,[52],
,
,Core modules,[,edit,],
,Drupal core includes optional modules that can be enabled by the administrator to extend the functionality of the core website.,[53],
,The core Drupal distribution provides a number of features, including:,[53],
,
,
,Access statistics and logging,
,Advanced search,
,Blogs, books, comments, forums, and polls,
,Caching and feature throttling for improved performance,
,Descriptive URLs,
,Multi-level menu system,
,Multi-site support,[54],
,Multi-user content creation and editing,
,OpenID, support,
,RSS feed and feed aggregator,
,Security and new release update notification,
,User profiles,
,Various access control restrictions (user roles, IP addresses, email),
,Workflow tools (triggers and actions),
,
,Core themes,[,edit,],
,Drupal includes core themes, which customize the ""look and feel"" of Drupal sites,,[55], for example, Garland and Bartik.
,The Color Module, introduced in Drupal core 5.0, allows administrators to change the color scheme of certain themes via a browser interface.,[56],
,
,Localization,[,edit,],
,As of January 2017,[update],, Drupal had been made available in 100 languages and ,English, (the default).,[57], Support is included for right-to-left languages such as ,Arabic,, ,Persian,, and ,Hebrew,.,[58],
,Drupal localization is built on top of ,gettext,, the GNU ,internationalization and localization, (i18n) library.
,
,Auto-update notification,[,edit,],
,Drupal can automatically notify the administrator about new versions of modules, themes, or the Drupal core.,[58], It's important to update quickly after security updates are released.
,Before updating it is highly recommended to take backup of core, modules, theme, files and database. If there is any error shown after update or if the new update is not compatible with a module, then it can be quickly replaced by backup. There are several backup modules available in Drupal.
,On October 15, 2014, a sql injection vulnerability was announced and update released.,[59], Two weeks later the Drupal security team released an advisory explaining that everyone should act under the assumption that any site not updated within 7 hours of the announcement are infected.,[60], Thus, it can be extremely important to apply these updates quickly and usage of a tool to make this process easier like ,drush, is highly recommended.
,
,Database abstraction,[,edit,],
,Prior to version 7, Drupal had functions that performed tasks related to databases, such as SQL query cleansing, multi-site table name prefixing, and generating proper SQL queries. In particular, Drupal 6 introduced an abstraction layer that allowed programmers to create SQL queries without writing SQL.
,Drupal 9 extends the data abstraction layer so that a programmer no longer needs to write SQL queries as text strings. It uses ,PHP Data Objects, to abstract the database. ,Microsoft, has written a database driver for their ,SQL Server,. Drupal 7 supports the file-based ,SQLite, database engine, which is part of the standard PHP distribution.
,
,Windows development,[,edit,],
,With Drupal 9's new database abstraction layer, and ability to run on the Windows web server ,IIS,, it is now easier for Windows developers to participate in the Drupal community.
,A group on Drupal.org is dedicated to Windows issues.,[61],
,
,Accessibility,[,edit,],
,Since the release of Drupal 7, ,Web accessibility, has been constantly improving in the Drupal community.,[62], Drupal is a good framework for building sites accessible to people with disabilities, because many of the best practices have been incorporated into Drupal Core. 
,Drupal 8 saw many improvements from the ,Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines, (ATAG) 2.0 guidelines which support both an accessible authoring environment as well as support for authors to produce more accessible content. 
,The accessibility team is carrying on the work of identifying and resolving accessibility barriers and raising awareness within the community.
,Drupal 8 has good semantic support for ,Rich Internet Applications, through ,WAI-ARIA,. There have been many improvements to both the visitor and administrator sides of Drupal, especially:
,
,Drag and drop functionality;,
,Improved color contrast and intensity;,
,Adding skip navigation to core themes;,
,Adding labels by default for input forms;,
,Fixing CSS display:none with consistent methods for hiding and exposing text on focus;,
,Adding support for ARIA Live Regions with Drupal.announce(); and,
,Adding a TabbingManager to support better keyboard navigation.,[63],
,The community also added an accessibility gate for core issues in Drupal 8.,[64],
,
,Extending the core,[,edit,],
,Drupal core is ,modular,, defining a system of ,hooks, and ,callbacks,, which are accessed internally via an ,API,.,[65], This design allows third-party contributed ,modules, and ,themes, to extend or override Drupal's default behaviors without changing Drupal core's code.
,Drupal isolates core files from contributed modules and themes. This increases flexibility and security and allows administrators to cleanly upgrade to new releases without overwriting their site's customizations.,[66], The Drupal community has the saying, ""Never hack core,"" a strong recommendation that site developers do not change core files.,[51],
,
,Modules,[,edit,],
,Contributed modules offer such additional or alternate features as image galleries, custom content types and content listings, ,WYSIWYG, editors, private messaging, third-party integration tools,,[67], integrating with BPM portals,,[68], and more. As of December 2019,[update], the Drupal website lists more than 44,000 free ,modules,.,[15],
,Some of the most commonly used contributed modules include:,[69],
,
,Content Construction Kit (CCK): allows site administrators to dynamically create content types by extending the database schema. ""Content type"" describes the kind of information. Content types include, but are not limited to, events, invitations, reviews, articles, and products. The CCK Fields API is in Drupal core in Drupal 7.,[70],[71],
,Views: facilitates the retrieval and presentation, through a database abstraction system, of content to site visitors. Basic views functionality has been added to core in Drupal 8.,[72],
,Panels: drag and drop layout manager that allows site administrators to visually design their site.,
,Rules: conditionally executed actions based on recurring events.,
,Features: enables the capture and management of features (entities, views, fields, configuration, etc.) into custom modules.,
,Context: allows definition of sections of site where Drupal features can be conditionally activated,
,Media: makes photo uploading and media management easier,
,Services: provides an API for Drupal.,
,Organic Groups Mailing List,
,Themes,[,edit,],
,As of December 2019,[update],, there are more than 2,800,[16], free community-contributed ,themes,. Themes adapt or replace a Drupal site's default look and feel.
,Drupal themes use standardized formats that may be generated by common third-party theme design engines. Many are written in the ,PHPTemplate, engine,[73], or, to a lesser extent, the ,XTemplate, engine.,[74], Some templates use hard-coded ,PHP,. Drupal 8 and future versions of Drupal integrate the ,Twig, templating engine.
,The inclusion of the PHPTemplate and XTemplate engines in Drupal addressed user concerns about flexibility and complexity.,[75], The Drupal theming system utilizes a ,template engine, to further separate ,HTML,/,CSS, from PHP. A popular Drupal contributed module called 'Devel' provides GUI information to developers and themers about the page build.
,Community-contributed themes,[76], at the Drupal website are released under a free ,GPL, license,,[77], and the most installed Drupal themes are ,listed on this page,.,[78],
,
,Distributions,[,edit,],
,In the past, those wanting a fully customized installation of Drupal had to download a pre-tailored version separately from the official Drupal core. Today, however, a distribution defines a packaged version of Drupal that upon installation, provides a website or application built for a specific purpose.
,The distributions offer the benefit of a new Drupal site without having to manually seek out and install third-party contributed modules or adjust configuration settings.,[79], They are collections of modules, themes, and associated configuration settings that prepare Drupal for custom operation. For example, a distribution could configure Drupal as a ""brochure"" site rather than a news site or ,online store,.
,
,Architecture,[,edit,],
,Drupal is based on the ,Presentation Abstraction Control, architecture, or PAC.
,The ,menu system, acts as the Controller. It accepts input via a single source (,HTTP GET, and ,POST,), routes requests to the appropriate helper functions, pulls data out of the Abstraction (nodes and, from Drupal 5 onwards, forms), and then pushes it through a filter to get a Presentation of it (the theme system).
,It even has multiple, parallel PAC agents in the form of blocks that push data out to a common canvas (page.tpl.php).,[80],
,
,Community,[,edit,],
,Drupal.org has a large community of users and developers who provide active ,community, support by coming up with new updates to help improve the functionality of Drupal,,[81], As of January 2017,[update], more than 105,400 users are actively contributing.,[14], The semiannual DrupalCon conference alternates between North America, Europe and Asia.,[82], Attendance at DrupalCon grew from 500 at ,Szeged, in August 2008, to over 3,700 people at Austin, Texas in June, 2014.
,Smaller events, known as ""Drupal Camps"" or DrupalCamp,,[83], occur throughout the year all over the world. The annual Florida DrupalCamp brings users together for ,Coding for a Cause, that benefits a local nonprofit organization, as does the annual GLADCamp (,Greater Los Angeles Drupal, Camp) event, ,Coders with a Cause,.
,The Drupal community also organizes professional and semi-professional gatherings called ,meetups, at a large number of venues around the world. 
,There are a number of active Drupal forums,,[84], mailing lists,[85], and discussion groups.,[86], Drupal also maintains several ,IRC, channels,[87], on the ,Freenode, network.
,There are over 30 national communities,[88], around drupal.org offering language-specific support.
,Notable Drupal users include ,NBC,, ,Taboola,, ,Patch,, and ,We the People,.,[89],
,
,Security,[,edit,],
,Drupal's policy is to announce the nature of each security vulnerability once the fix is released.,[90],[91],
,Administrators of Drupal sites are automatically notified of these new releases via the Update Status module (Drupal 6) or via the Update Manager (Drupal 7).,[92],
,Drupal maintains a security announcement mailing list, a history of all security advisories,,[93], a security team home page,,[94], and an RSS feed,[95], with the most recent security advisories.
,In mid-October 2014,,[96], Drupal issued a ""highly critical"" security advisory regarding an ,SQL injection, bug in Drupal 7, also known as Drupalgeddon.,[97],[98],
,Downloading and installing an upgrade to Drupal 7.32 fixes the vulnerability, but does not remove any ,backdoor, installed by hackers if the site has already been ,compromised,.,[99], Attacks began soon after the vulnerability was announced. According to the Drupal security team, where a site was not patched within hours of the announcement, it should be considered compromised and taken offline by being replaced with a static HTML page while the administrator of its server must be told that other sites on the same server may also have been compromised.
,To solve the problem, the site must be restored using backups from before October 15, be patched and manually updated, and anything merged from the site must be audited.,[100],
,In late March 2018, a patch for vulnerability ,CVE,-,.mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:""\""""""\""""""'""""'""}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background-image:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png"");background-image:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg"");background-repeat:no-repeat;background-size:9px;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background-image:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png"");background-image:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg"");background-repeat:no-repeat;background-size:9px;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background-image:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png"");background-image:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg"");background-repeat:no-repeat;background-size:9px;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-image:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png"");background-image:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"");background-repeat:no-repeat;background-size:12px;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit},2018-7600,, also dubbed ,Drupalgeddon2,, was released. The underlying bug allows remote attackers without special roles or permissions to take complete control of Drupal 6, 7, and 8 sites.,[101], Starting early April, large scale automated attacks against vulnerable sites were observed,,[102], and on April 20, a high level of penetration of unpatched sites was reported.,[103],
,On 23 December 2019, Drupal patched an arbitrary file upload flaw. The file-upload flaw affects Drupal 8.8.x before 8.8.1 and 8.7.x before 8.7.11, and the vulnerability is listed as moderately critical by Drupal.,[104],[105],

If you find that your site is already patched but you didn’t do it, that can be a symptom that the site was compromised - some attacks have applied the patch as a way to guarantee they are the only attacker in control of the site.,

,Clojure, (,/,ˈ,k,l,oʊ,ʒ,ər,/,, like ,closure,),[15],[16], is a modern, ,dynamic,, and ,functional, ,dialect, of the ,Lisp programming language, on the ,Java, platform.,[17],[18], Like other Lisps, Clojure treats ,code as data, and has a ,Lisp macro, system.,[19], The current development process is ,community,-driven,,[20], overseen by ,Rich Hickey, as its ,benevolent dictator for life, (BDFL).,[21],
,Clojure advocates ,immutability, and ,immutable data structures, and encourages programmers to be explicit about managing identity and its states.,[22], This focus on programming with immutable values and explicit progression-of-time constructs is intended to facilitate developing more robust, especially ,concurrent,, programs that are simple and fast.,[23],[24],[15], While its type system is entirely ,dynamic,, recent efforts have also sought the implementation of ,gradual typing,.,[25],
,Commercial support for Clojure is provided by Cognitect.,[26], Clojure conferences are organized every year across the globe, the most famous of them being Clojure/conj.,[27],

,History and development process,[,edit,],
,  ,Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure,
,Rich Hickey is the creator of the Clojure language.,[17], Before Clojure, he developed dotLisp, a similar project based on the ,.NET, platform,,[28], and three earlier attempts to provide interoperability between Lisp and ,Java,: a ,Java foreign language interface for ,Common Lisp, (jfli),,[29], A ,Foreign Object Interface for Lisp, (FOIL),,[30], and a ,Lisp-friendly interface to Java Servlets, (Lisplets).,[31],
,Hickey spent about 2½ years working on Clojure before releasing it publicly, much of that time working exclusively on Clojure with no outside funding. At the end of this time, Hickey sent an email announcing the language to some friends in the Common Lisp community.
,The development process is community-driven,[20], and is managed at the Clojure ,JIRA, project page.,[32], General development discussion occurs at the Clojure Google Group.,[33], Anyone can submit issues and ideas at ask.clojure.org,[34],, but to contribute patches, one must sign the Clojure Contributor agreement.,[35], JIRA issues are processed by a team of screeners and finally Rich Hickey approves the changes.,[36],
,Clojure's name, according to Hickey, is a ,pun, on the programming concept "",closure,"" incorporating the letters C, L, and J for ,C#,, ,Lisp,, and ,Java, respectively—three languages which had a major influence on Clojure's design.,[37],
,
,Design philosophy,[,edit,],
,Rich Hickey developed Clojure because he wanted a modern ,Lisp, for ,functional programming,, symbiotic with the established ,Java, platform, and designed for ,concurrency,.,[23],[24],[38],[15],
,Clojure's approach to ,state, is characterized by the concept of identities,,[22], which are represented as a series of immutable states over time. Since states are immutable values, any number of workers can operate on them in parallel, and concurrency becomes a question of managing changes from one state to another. For this purpose, Clojure provides several mutable ,reference types,, each having well-defined semantics for the transition between states.,[22],

,
,Clojure runs on the ,Java, platform and as a result, integrates with ,Java, and fully supports calling Java code from Clojure,,[52],[15], and Clojure code can be called from Java also.,[53], The community uses ,Leiningen, for project automation, providing support for ,Maven, integration. Leiningen handles project package management and dependencies and is configured using Clojure syntax.,[54],
,Like most other Lisps, Clojure's syntax is built on ,S-expressions, that are first parsed into data structures by a reader before being compiled.,[55],[15], Clojure's ,reader, supports literal syntax for ,maps,, sets and ,vectors, in addition to lists, and these are compiled to the mentioned structures directly.,[55], Clojure is a ,Lisp-1, and is not intended to be code-compatible with other dialects of Lisp, since it uses its own set of data structures incompatible with other Lisps.,[19],
,As a Lisp dialect, Clojure supports ,functions, as ,first-class objects,, a ,read–eval–print loop, (REPL), and a macro system.,[6], Clojure's ,Lisp macro, system is very similar to that in ,Common Lisp, with the exception that Clojure's version of the ,backquote, (termed ""syntax quote"") qualifies symbols with their ,namespace,. This helps prevent unintended name capture, as binding to namespace-qualified names is forbidden. It is possible to force a capturing macro expansion, but it must be done explicitly. Clojure does not allow user-defined reader macros, but the reader supports a more constrained form of syntactic extension.,[56], Clojure supports ,multimethods,[57], and for ,interface,-like abstractions has a ,protocol,[58], based polymorphism and data type system using ,records,,,[59], providing high-performance and dynamic polymorphism designed to avoid the ,expression problem,.
,Clojure has support for ,lazy sequences, and encourages the principle of ,immutability, and ,persistent data structures,. As a ,functional language,, emphasis is placed on ,recursion, and ,higher-order functions, instead of side-effect-based looping. Automatic ,tail call, optimization is not supported as the JVM does not support it natively;,[60],[61],[62], it is possible to do so explicitly by using the ,recur, keyword.,[63], For ,parallel, and ,concurrent, programming Clojure provides ,software transactional memory,,,[64], a reactive ,agent system,,,[1], and ,channel,-based concurrent programming.,[65],
,Clojure 1.7 introduced reader conditionals by allowing the embedding of Clojure and ClojureScript code in the same namespace.,[48],[55], Transducers were added as a method for composing transformations. Transducers enable higher-order functions such as ,map, and ,fold, to generalize over any source of input data. While traditionally these functions operate on ,sequences,, transducers allow them to work on channels and let the user define their own models for transduction.,[66],[67],[68],
,
,Platforms,[,edit,],
,The primary platform of Clojure is ,Java,,,[18],[52], but other target implementations exist. The most notable of these are ClojureScript,,[69], which compiles to ,ECMAScript, 3,,[70], and ClojureCLR,,[71], a full port on the ,.NET, platform, interoperable with its ecosystem. A survey of the Clojure community with 1,060 respondents conducted in 2013,[72], found that 47% of respondents used both Clojure and ClojureScript when working with Clojure. In 2014 this number had increased to 55%,,[73], in 2015, based on 2,445 respondents, to 66%.,[74], Popular ClojureScript projects include implementations of the ,React, library such as Reagent,,[75], re-frame,,[76], Rum,,[77], and Om.,[78],[79],
,
,Popularity,[,edit,],
,With the continued interest in functional programming, Clojure's adoption by the software developers on the Java platform has kept increasing. The language has also been either favored or recommended by renowned software development veterans such as Brian Goetz,,[80],[81],[82], Eric Evans,,[83],[84], ,James Gosling,,,[85], ,Paul Graham,,,[86], and ,Robert C. Martin, (colloquially known as ""Uncle Bob"").,[87],[88],[89],[90],
,In the ""JVM Ecosystem Report 2018"" (which was claimed to be ""the largest survey ever of Java developers""), prepared in collaboration by Snyk and Java Magazine, Clojure was ranked the 2nd most used programming language (behind Java) for ""main applications"".,[91],
,Clojure is used in industry by firms,[92], such as ,Apple,,,[93],[94], ,Atlassian,,,[95], ,Funding Circle,,,[96], ,Netflix,,,[97], ,Puppet,,,[98], and ,Walmart,[99], as well as government agencies such as ,NASA,.,[100], It has also been used for creative computing, including visual art, music, games, and poetry.,[101],
,ThoughtWorks,, while assessing functional programming languages for their Technology Radar,,[102], expressed their favor toward Clojure as ""a simple, elegant implementation of Lisp on the JVM"" in 2010 and promoted its status to ""ADOPT"" in 2012.,[103],
,A growing number of unofficial and experimental implementations for other platforms testify to the popularity of the language:
,
,CljPerl,,[104], Clojure atop ,Perl,
,Clojerl,,[105], Clojure on ,BEAM,, the ,Erlang, virtual machine,
,clojure-py,,[106], Clojure in pure ,Python,
,Ferret,,[107], compiles to self-contained C++11 that can run on microcontrollers,
,Joker,,[108], an interpreter and ,linter, written in ,Go,
,Las3r,,[109], a subset of Clojure that runs on the ,ActionScript, Virtual Machine (the Adobe Flash Player platform),
,Pixie,,[110], Clojure-inspired Lisp dialect written in ,RPython,
,Rouge,,[111], Clojure atop YARV in ,Ruby,
,Tools,[,edit,],
,Tooling for Clojure development has seen significant improvement over the years. The following is a list of the most popular ,IDEs,/editors with their plug-ins that combined provide excellent support for Clojure development:,[112],
,
,Atom,, with Chlorine,[113],
,Emacs,, with CIDER,[114],
,IntelliJ IDEA,, with Clojure-Kit,[115], or Cursive,[116], (a free license is available for ,non-commercial, use),
,Light Table,
,Vim,, with fireplace.vim,[117],[118],, vim-iced,[119],, or Conjure (Neovim only),[120],[121],
,Visual Studio Code,, with Calva,[122],
,In addition to the tools provided by the community, the official Clojure ,CLI, tools,[123], have also become available on ,GNU/Linux,, ,macOS,, and ,Windows, since Clojure 1.9.,[124],
,
,Features by example,[,edit,],
,The following examples can be run in a Clojure REPL such as one started with the Clojure CLI tools,[123], or an online REPL such as one available on REPL.it.,[125],
,
,Simplicity,[,edit,],
,Because of the strong emphasis on simplicity, typical Clojure programs consist of mostly functions and simple data structures (i.e., lists, vectors, maps, and sets):
,
,;; A typical entry point of a Clojure program:,
,;;   `-main` function,
,(,defn ,-main, ,; name,
  ,[,&, ,args,], ,; (variable) parameters,
  ,(,println ,""Hello, World!"",)), ,; body,
,
,Programming at REPL,[,edit,],
,Like other ,Lisps,, one of the iconic features of Clojure is interactive programming at the ,REPL,.,[126], Note that, in the following examples, ,;;, starts a line comment and ,;; =>, indicates output:
,
,;; define a var,
,(,def ,a, ,42,),
,;; => #'user/a,

,;; call a function named `+`,
,(,+ ,a, ,8,),
,;; => 50,

,;; call a function named `even?`,
,(,even?, ,a,),
,;; => true,

,;; define a function that returns the remainder of `n` when divided by 10,
,(,defn ,foo, ,[,n,], ,(,rem ,n, ,10,)),
,;; => #'user/foo,

,;; call the function,
,(,foo, ,a,),
,;; => 2,

,;; print the docstring of `rem`,
,(,doc ,rem,),
,;; =>,
,-------------------------,
,clojure.core/rem,
,([,num, ,div,]),
 ,remainder, ,of, ,dividing, ,numerator, ,by, ,denominator.,

,;; print the source of `rem`,
,(,source, ,rem,),
,;; =>,
,(,defn ,rem,
  ,""remainder of dividing numerator by denominator."",
  ,{,:added, ,""1.0"",
   ,:static, ,true,
   ,:inline, ,(,fn ,[,x, ,y,], ,`,(,. ,clojure.lang.Numbers, ,(,remainder, ,~,x, ,~,y,)))},
  ,[,num, ,div,],
    ,(,. ,clojure.lang.Numbers, ,(,remainder, ,num, ,div,))),
,
,Names at runtime,[,edit,],
,Unlike other runtime environments where names get compiled away, Clojure's runtime environment is easily introspectable using normal Clojure data structures:
,
,;; define a var,
,(,def ,a, ,42,),
,;; => #'user/a,

,;; get a map of all public vars interned in the `user` namespace,
,(,ns-publics ,'user,),
,;; => {a #'user/a},

,;; reference the var via `#'` (reader macro) and,
,;; its associated, namespace-qualified symbol `user/a`,
,#,'user/a,
,;; => #'user/a,

,;; de-reference (get the value of) the var,
,(,deref ,#,'user/a,),
,;; => 42,

,;; define a function (with a docstring) that,
,;; returns the remainder of `n` when divided by 10,
,(,defn ,foo, ,""returns `(rem n 10)`"", ,[,n,], ,(,rem ,n, ,10,)),
,;; => #'user/foo,

,;; get the metadata of the var `#'user/foo`,
,(,meta ,#,'user/foo,),
,;; =>,
,{,:arglists, ,([,n,]),,
 ,:doc, ,""returns `(rem n 10)`"",,
 ,:line, ,1,,
 ,:column, ,1,,
 ,:file, ,""user.clj"",,
 ,:name, ,foo,,
 ,:ns, ,#,namespace,[,user,]},
,
,Code as data (homoiconicity),[,edit,],
,Similar to other ,Lisps,, Clojure is ,homoiconic, (also known as ,code as data,). In the example below, we can see how easy it is to write code that modifies code itself:
,
,;; call a function (code),
,(,+ ,1, ,1,),
,;; => 2,

,;; quote the function call,
,;; (turning code into data, which is a list of symbols),
,(,quote ,(,+ ,1, ,1,)),
,;; => (+ 1 1),

,;; get the first element on the list,
,;; (operating on code as data),
,(,first ,(,quote ,(,+ ,1, ,1,))),
,;; => +,

,;; get the last element on the list,
,;; (operating on code as data),
,(,last ,(,quote ,(,+ ,1, ,1,))),
,;; => 1,

,;; get a new list by replacing the symbols on the original list,
,;; (manipulating code as data),
,(,map ,(,fn ,[,form,],
       ,(,case, ,form,
         ,1, ,'one,
         ,+ ,'plus,)),
     ,(,quote ,(,+ ,1, ,1,))),
,;; => (plus one one),
,
,Expressive operators for data transformation,[,edit,],
,The threading macros (,->,, ,->>,, and friends) can syntactically express the abstraction of piping a collection of data through a series of transformations:
,
,(,->>, ,(,range ,10,),
     ,(,map ,inc,),
     ,(,filter ,even?,)),
,;; => (2 4 6 8 10),
,
,This can also be achieved more efficiently using transducers:
,
,(,sequence, ,(,comp ,(,map ,inc,),
                ,(,filter ,even?,)),
          ,(,range ,10,)),
,;; => (2 4 6 8 10),
,
,Thread-safe management of identity and state,[,edit,],
,A ,thread-safe, generator of unique serial numbers (though, like many other Lisp dialects, Clojure has a built-in ,gensym, function that it uses internally):
,
,(,def ,i, ,(,atom, ,0,)),

,(,defn ,generate-unique-id,
  ,""Returns a distinct numeric ID for each call."",
  ,[],
  ,(,swap!, ,i, ,inc,)),
,
,Macros,[,edit,],
,An anonymous subclass of ,java.io.Writer, that doesn't write to anything, and a macro using it to silence all prints within it:
,
,(,def ,bit-bucket-writer,
  ,(,proxy ,[,java.io.Writer,], ,[],
    ,(,write, ,[,buf,], ,nil,),
    ,(,close, ,[],    ,nil,),
    ,(,flush ,[],    ,nil,))),

,(,defmacro ,noprint,
  ,""Evaluates the given `forms` with all printing to `*out*` silenced."",
  ,[,&, ,forms,],
  ,`,(,binding ,[,*out*, ,bit-bucket-writer,],
     ,~@,forms,)),

,(,noprint,
  ,(,println ,""Hello, nobody!"",)),
,;; => nil,
,
,Language interoperability with Java,[,edit,],
,Clojure was created from the ground up to embrace its host platforms as one of its design goals and thus provides excellent ,language interoperability, with Java:
,
,;; call an instance method,
,(,.toUpperCase, ,""apple"",),
,;; => ""APPLE"",

,;; call a static method,
,(,System/getProperty, ,""java.vm.version"",),
,;; => ""12+33"",

,;; create an instance of `java.util.HashMap` and,
,;; add some entries,
,(,doto ,(,java.util.HashMap.,),
  ,(,.put, ,""apple"", ,1,),
  ,(,.put, ,""banana"", ,2,)),
,;; => {""banana"" 2, ""apple"" 1},

,;; create an instance of `java.util.ArrayList` and,
,;; increment its elements with `clojure.core/map`,
,(,def ,al, ,(,doto ,(,java.util.ArrayList.,),
          ,(,.add, ,1,),
          ,(,.add, ,2,),
          ,(,.add, ,3,))),

,(,map inc ,al,),
,;; => (2 3 4),

,;; show a message dialog using Java Swing,
,(,javax.swing.JOptionPane/showMessageDialog,
  ,nil,
  ,""Hello, World!"",),
,;; => nil,
,
,Software transactional memory,[,edit,],
,10 threads manipulating one shared data structure, which consists of 100 vectors each one containing 10 (initially sequential) unique numbers. Each thread then repeatedly selects two random positions in two random vectors and swaps them. All changes to the vectors occur in transactions by making use of Clojure's ,software transactional memory, system:
,
,(,defn ,run,
  ,[,nvecs, ,nitems, ,nthreads, ,niters,],
  ,(,let ,[,vec-refs,
        ,(,->>, ,(,* ,nvecs, ,nitems,),
             ,(,range,),
             ,(,into ,[], ,(,comp ,(,partition-all, ,nitems,),
                            ,(,map ,vec,),
                            ,(,map ,ref,)))),

        ,swap,
        ,#,(,let ,[,v1, ,(,rand-int ,nvecs,),
               ,v2, ,(,rand-int ,nvecs,),
               ,i1, ,(,rand-int ,nitems,),
               ,i2, ,(,rand-int ,nitems,)],
          ,(,dosync,
            ,(,let ,[,tmp, ,(,nth ,@,(,vec-refs, ,v1,), ,i1,)],
              ,(,alter ,(,vec-refs, ,v1,), ,assoc ,i1, ,(,nth ,@,(,vec-refs, ,v2,), ,i2,)),
              ,(,alter ,(,vec-refs, ,v2,), ,assoc ,i2, ,tmp,)))),

        ,report,
        ,#,(,->>, ,vec-refs,
              ,(,into ,[], ,(,comp ,(,map ,deref,),
                             ,(,map ,(,fn ,[,v,], ,(,prn ,v,), ,v,)),
                             ,cat,
                             ,(,distinct,))),
              ,(,count,),
              ,(,println ,""Distinct:"",))],

    ,(,report,),

    ,(,->>, ,#,(,dotimes ,[,_, ,niters,], ,(,swap,)),
         ,(,repeat ,nthreads,),
         ,(,apply ,pcalls,),

,Ruby on Rails,, or ,Rails,, is a ,server-side, ,web application framework, written in ,Ruby, under the ,MIT License,. Rails is a ,model–view–controller, (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a ,database,, a ,web service,, and ,web pages,. It encourages and facilitates the use of ,web standards, such as ,JSON, or ,XML, for data transfer and ,HTML,, ,CSS, and ,JavaScript, for user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known ,software engineering, ,patterns, and paradigms, including ,convention over configuration, (CoC), ,don't repeat yourself, (DRY), and the ,active record pattern,.,[4],
,Ruby on Rails' emergence in 2005 greatly influenced web app development, through innovative features such as seamless database ,table, creations, ,migrations,, and ,scaffolding, of views to enable rapid application development. Ruby on Rails' influence on other web frameworks remains apparent today, with many frameworks in other languages borrowing its ideas, including ,Django, in ,Python,, ,Catalyst, in ,Perl,, ,Laravel, and ,CakePHP, in ,PHP,, ,Phoenix, in ,Elixir,, ,Play, in ,Scala,, and ,Sails.js, in ,Node.js,.

,History,[,edit,],
,David Heinemeier Hansson, extracted Ruby on Rails from his work on the project management tool ,Basecamp, at the ,web application, company also called ,Basecamp, (37Signals at the time).,[5], Hansson first released Rails as open source in July 2004, but did not share ,commit, rights to the project until February 2005.,[,citation needed,], In August 2006, the framework reached a milestone when ,Apple, announced that it would ship Ruby on Rails with ,Mac OS X v10.5 ""Leopard"",,,[6], which was released in October 2007.
,Rails version 2.3 was released on March 15, 2009, with major new developments in templates, engines, ,Rack, and nested model forms. Templates enable the developer to generate a skeleton application with custom ,gems, and configurations. Engines give developers the ability to reuse application pieces complete with routes, view paths and models. The Rack web server interface and Metal allow one to write optimized pieces of code that route around Action Controller.,[7],
,On December 23, 2008, ,Merb,, another web application framework, was launched, and Ruby on Rails announced it would work with the Merb project to bring ""the best ideas of Merb"" into Rails 3, ending the ""unnecessary duplication"" across both communities.,[8], Merb was merged with Rails as part of the Rails 3.0 release.,[9],[10],

,Technical overview,[,edit,],
,Like other web frameworks, Ruby on Rails uses the ,model–view–controller, (MVC) pattern to organize application programming.
,In a default configuration, a ,model, in the Ruby on Rails framework maps to a table in a database and to a Ruby file. For example, a model class ,User, will usually be defined in the file 'user.rb' in the app/models directory, and linked to the table 'users' in the database. While developers are free to ignore this convention and choose differing names for their models, files, and database table, this is not common practice and is usually discouraged in accordance with the "",convention-over-configuration,"" philosophy.
,A ,controller, is a server-side component of Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application, by determining which view file to render. The controller may also have to query one or more models for information and pass these on to the view. For example, in an airline reservation system, a controller implementing a flight-search function would need to query a model representing individual flights to find flights matching the search, and might also need to query models representing airports and airlines to find related secondary data. The controller might then pass some subset of the flight data to the corresponding view, which would contain a mixture of static HTML and logic that use the flight data to create an HTML document containing a table with one row per flight. A controller may provide one or more actions. In Ruby on Rails, an action is typically a basic unit that describes how to respond to a specific external web-browser request. Also, note that the controller/action will be accessible for external web requests only if a corresponding route is mapped to it. Rails encourages developers to use ,RESTful, routes, which include actions such as create, new, edit, update, destroy, show, and index. These mappings of incoming requests/routes to controller actions can be easily set up in the routes.rb configuration file.
,A ,view, in the default configuration of Rails is an ,erb, file, which is evaluated and converted to ,HTML, at run-time. Alternatively, many other templating systems can be used for views.
,Ruby on Rails includes tools that make common development tasks easier ""out-of-the-box"", such as ,scaffolding, that can automatically construct some of the models and views needed for a basic ,website,.,[35], Also included are ,WEBrick,, a simple Ruby web server that is distributed with Ruby, and ,Rake,, a build system, distributed as a ,gem,. Together with Ruby on Rails, these tools provide a basic development environment.
,Ruby on Rails is most commonly not connected to the Internet directly, but through some front-end ,web server,. ,Mongrel, was generally preferred,[,by whom?,], over WEBrick in the early days,,[,citation needed,], but it can also run on ,Lighttpd,, ,Apache,, ,Cherokee,, ,Hiawatha,, ,Nginx, (either as a module – ,Phusion Passenger, for example – or via ,CGI,, ,FastCGI, or ,mod_ruby,), and many others. From 2008 onward, Passenger replaced Mongrel as the most-used web server for Ruby on Rails.,[36], Ruby is also supported natively on the ,IBM i,.,[37],
,Ruby on Rails is also noteworthy for its extensive use of the ,JavaScript, libraries, ,Prototype, and ,Script.aculo.us,, for scripting ,Ajax, actions.,[38], Ruby on Rails initially utilized lightweight ,SOAP, for web services; this was later replaced by RESTful ,web services,. Ruby on Rails 3.0 uses a technique called ,Unobtrusive JavaScript, to separate the functionality (or logic) from the structure of the web page. jQuery is fully supported as a replacement for Prototype and is the default JavaScript library in Rails 3.1, reflecting an industry-wide move towards jQuery. Additionally, ,CoffeeScript, was introduced in Rails 3.1 as the default JavaScript language.
,Since version 2.0, Ruby on Rails offers both HTML and XML as standard output formats. The latter is the facility for RESTful web services.
,Rails 3.1 introduced ,Sass, as standard ,CSS, templating.
,By default, the server uses ,Embedded Ruby, in the HTML views, with files having an html.erb extension.  Rails supports swapping-in alternative templating languages, such as ,HAML, and ,Mustache,.
,Ruby on Rails 3.0 has been designed to work with Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby 1.9.2, and ,JRuby, 1.5.2+; earlier versions are not supported.,[39],
,Ruby on Rails 3.2 is the last series of releases that support Ruby 1.8.7.
,
,Framework structure,[,edit,],
,Ruby on Rails is separated into various packages, namely ,ActiveRecord, (an ,object-relational mapping, system for database access), Action Pack, Active Support and Action Mailer. Prior to version 2.0, Ruby on Rails also included the Action Web Service package that is now replaced by Active Resource. Apart from standard packages, developers can make ,plugins, to extend existing packages. Earlier Rails supported plugins within their own custom framework; version 3.2 deprecates these in favor of standard Ruby ""gems"".,[40],
,
,Deployment,[,edit,],
,Ruby on Rails is often installed using ,RubyGems,, a package manager,[41], which is included with current versions of Ruby. Many free ,Unix-like systems, also support installation of Ruby on Rails and its dependencies through their native ,package management system,.
,Ruby on Rails is typically deployed with a database server such as ,MySQL, or ,PostgreSQL,, and a web server such as ,Apache, running the ,Phusion Passenger, module.
,
,Philosophy and design,[,edit,],
,Ruby on Rails is intended to emphasize ,Convention over Configuration, (CoC), and the ,Don't Repeat Yourself, (DRY) principle.
,""Convention over Configuration"" means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application. For example, if there is a class ,Sale, in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called ,sales, by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as calling the table ""products sold"", that the developer needs to write code regarding these names. Generally, Ruby on Rails conventions lead to less code and less repetition.,[42],
,""Don't repeat yourself"" means that information is located in a single, unambiguous place. For example, using the ,ActiveRecord, module of Rails, the developer does not need to specify database column names in class definitions. Instead, Ruby on Rails can retrieve this information from the database based on the class name.
,""Fat models, skinny controllers"" means that most of the application logic should be placed within the model while leaving the controller as light as possible.
,
,Trademarks,[,edit,],
,In March 2007, ,David Heinemeier Hansson, filed three Ruby on Rails-related ,trademark, applications to the ,USPTO,. These applications regard the phrase ""RUBY ON RAILS"",,[43], the word ""RAILS"",,[44], and the official Rails logo.,[45], As a consequence, in the summer of 2007, Hansson denied permission to ,Apress, to use the Ruby on Rails logo on the cover of a new Ruby on Rails book written by some authoritative community members. The episode gave rise to a polite protest in the Ruby on Rails community.,[46],[47], In response to this criticism, Hansson replied:
,
,I only grant promotional use [of the Rails logo] for products I'm directly involved with. Such as books that I've been part of the development process for or conferences where I have a say in the execution. I would most definitely seek to enforce all the trademarks of Rails.,[46],
,Reception,[,edit,],
,Scalability,[,edit,],
,Rails running on ,Matz's Ruby Interpreter, (the ,de facto, reference interpreter for Ruby) had been criticized for issues with scalability.,[48], These critics often mentioned various ,Twitter, outages in 2007 and 2008, which spurred Twitter's partial transition to ,Scala, (which runs on the ,Java Virtual Machine,) for their ,queueing system, and other ,middleware,.,[49],[50], The user interface aspects of the site continued to run Ruby on Rails,[51], until 2011 when it was replaced due to concerns over performance,[52],
,In 2011, ,Gartner Research, noted that despite criticisms and comparisons to Java, many high-profile consumer web firms are using Ruby on Rails to build scalable web applications. Some of the largest sites running Ruby on Rails include ,Airbnb,, ,GitHub,, ,Scribd,, ,Shopify,, ,Hulu,, and ,Basecamp,.,[53], As of January 2016, it is estimated that more than 1.2 million web sites are running Ruby on Rails.,[54],[55],
,
,Security,[,edit,],
,In March 2012, security researcher Egor Homakov discovered a ""mass assignment"" vulnerability that allowed certain Rails applications to be remotely exploited, and demonstrated it by non-maliciously hacking ,GitHub, after his earlier attempts at responsible disclosure were dismissed.,[56],
,On September 24, 2013, a session cookie persistence security flaw was reported in Ruby on Rails. In a default configuration, the entire session hash is stored within a session cookie known as ,CookieStore,, allowing any authenticated session possessing the session cookie to log in as the target user at any time in the future. As a workaround, administrators are advised to configure cookies to be stored on the server using mechanisms such as ,ActiveRecordStore,.,[57],
,Researchers Daniel Jackson and Joseph Near developed a data debugger they called ""Space"" that can analyze the data access of a Rails program and determine if the program properly adheres to rules regarding access restrictions. On April 15, 2016, Near reported that an analysis of 50 popular Web applications using Space uncovered 23 previously unknown security flaws.,[58],

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homesteading_the_Noosphere,""",Homesteading the Noosphere,"" (abbreviated ,HtN,) is an ,essay, written by ,Eric S. Raymond, about the social workings of ,open-source, ,software development,. It follows his previous piece "",The Cathedral and the Bazaar,"" (1997).
,The essay examines issues of ,project, ownership and transfer, as well as investigating possible ,anthropological, roots of the ,gift culture, in open source as contrasted with the exchange culture of ,closed source, software. Raymond also investigates the nature of the spread of open source into the untamed frontier of ideas he terms the ,noosphere,, postulating that projects that range too far ahead of their time fail because they are too far out in the wilderness, and that successful projects tend to relate to existing projects.
,Raymond delves into the contrast between the stated aims of open source and observed behaviors, and also explores the underlying motivations of people involved in the ,open source movement,. He notes that a key motivation for open source practitioners is having a great ,reputation, within the ""tribe"".

,Personal life,[,edit,],
,Buterin was born in ,Kolomna,, ,Moscow Oblast,, ,Russia,, to Dmitry Buterin, a computer scientist,,[4], and Natalia Ameline (née Chistyakova). He lived in the area until the age of six when his parents emigrated to ,Canada, in search of better employment opportunities.,[5], While in grade three of elementary school in Canada, Buterin was placed into a class for gifted children,[6], and started to understand that he was drawn to math, programming, and economics.
,Buterin attended the ,Abelard School,, a private high school in Toronto, for four years,,[7], which he said, ""proved to be among the most interesting and productive years of my life; the closer connection between students and teachers [&] the level of depth at which the material was taught, made me want to learn, and to focus on learning as my primary goal"".,[7], Buterin has written that although he was ""never particularly inspired by the traditional education system"",,[7], when subjects were presented with ""dedication and focus on intellectual inquiry"", he said:
,
,""I noticed my attitude and my results almost immediately and drastically change. Education is ultimately much more than simply memorizing individual facts, or even learning individual concepts. [What] matters most: learning how to think, learning how to reason and learning how to learn."",[7],
,Buterin learned about Bitcoin, from his father, at age 17.,[5], In 2012, he obtained a bronze medal in the International Olympiad in Informatics.,[8], In 2013, he visited developers in other countries who shared his enthusiasm for code. He returned to Toronto later that year and published a ,white paper, proposing Ethereum.,[9], He attended the ,University of Waterloo, but dropped out in 2014, when he received the ,Thiel Fellowship, in the amount of $100,000,,[10], and went to work on Ethereum full-time.,[10],
,On June 25, 2017, Buterin was the subject of a ,death hoax, originating from ,4chan,.,[,citation needed,],
,On 30 November 2018, Buterin received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Business and Economics of the University of Basel on the occasion of the Dies Academicus.,[11],
,
,Career,[,edit,],
,Bitcoin Magazine,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Bitcoin Magazine,
,Buterin met a person on a bitcoin chat forum trying to start a bitcoin blog. The owner offered five bitcoin (about $3.50 at the time) to anyone who would write an article for him. Buterin wrote for the site until its website shut down soon thereafter due to Bitcoin's lack of mainstream attention.,[12],
,In September 2011, another person reached out to Buterin about a new publication called ,Bitcoin Magazine,, a position which Buterin would accept as the first co-founder, and contribute as a leading writer.,[13],
,In addition Buterin wrote about bitcoin-related topics for other publications, including ,Bitcoin Weekly,.,[1], ,Bitcoin Magazine, in 2012 later began publishing a print edition and has been referred to as the first serious publication dedicated to cryptocurrencies.,[14], ,Bitcoin Magazine, was then purchased by BTC Media, where Buterin continued to write until mid-2014.,[,citation needed,],
,In addition, he held a position on the editorial board of ,Ledger,, a peer-reviewed scholarly journal that publishes full-length original research articles on the subjects of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.,[15],
,
,Ethereum,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Ethereum,
,Buterin is a co-founder and inventor of Ethereum, described as a ""decentralised mining network and software development platform rolled into one"",[,citation needed,], that facilitates the creation of new cryptocurrencies and programs that share a single ,blockchain, (a cryptographic transaction ledger).,[16],[17],
,Buterin first described Ethereum in a white paper,[18], in late 2013. Buterin argued that bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. But when he failed to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.,[19],:,88, About the Ethereum Project, Buterin has said: ""I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to work in such an interesting and interdisciplinary area of industry, where I have the chance to interact with cryptographers, mathematicians and economists prominent in their fields, to help build software and tools that already affect tens of thousands of people around the world, and to work on advanced problems in computer science, economics and philosophy every week."",[7], However, in a 2018 New Yorker article, his father suggests that Buterin is trying to avoid the focus on him as the philosopher king of the blockchain world. “He is trying to focus his time on research,” Dmitry [Buterin's father] said. “He’s not too excited that the community assigns so much importance to him. He wants the community to be more resilient.”,[20],
,
,Open source software,[,edit,],
,Buterin has contributed as a developer to other open source software projects.,[1], He also contributed to DarkWallet,[21], by ,Cody Wilson,, ,Bitcoin, ,Python, libraries,,[22], and the ,cryptocurrency, marketplace site Egora.,[2],
,
,Ethereum Russia,[,edit,],
,As Buterin was recognizing the economic and political relevance of the Ethereum enterprise for his native Russia, he met with ,Vladimir Putin, on June 2, 2017, at the ,St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, (SPIEF) event. The president of Russia stated that he ""supported the idea of establishing ties with possible Russian partners"".,[23],

,Early life,[,edit,],
,Raymond was born in ,Boston, Massachusetts,, in 1957 and lived in Venezuela as a child. His family moved to ,Pennsylvania, in 1971.,[4], He developed ,cerebral palsy, at birth; his weakened physical condition motivated him to go into computing.,[5],
,
,Career,[,edit,],
,Raymond began his programming career writing proprietary software, between 1980 and 1985.,[1], In 1990, noting that the ,Jargon File, had not been maintained since about 1983, he adopted it; he currently has a third edition in print. ,Paul Dourish, maintains an archived original version of the Jargon File, because, he says, Raymond's updates ""essentially destroyed what held it together."",[6],
,In 1996 Raymond took over development of the open-source email software ""popclient"", renaming it to ,Fetchmail,.,[7], Soon after this experience, in 1997, he wrote the essay "",The Cathedral and the Bazaar,"", detailing his thoughts on ,open-source software development, and why it should be done as openly as possible (the ""bazaar"" approach). The essay was based in part on his experience in developing Fetchmail. He first presented his thesis at the annual ,Linux Kongress, on May 27, 1997. He later expanded the essay into a book, ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary,, in 1999. The essay has been widely cited.,[8], The internal white paper by Frank Hecker that led to the release of the ,Mozilla, (then ,Netscape,) source code in 1998 cited ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar, as ""independent validation"" of ideas proposed by ,Eric Hahn, and ,Jamie Zawinski,.,[9], Hahn would later describe the 1999 book as ""clearly influential"".,[10],:,190,
,From the late 1990s onward, due in part to the popularity of his essay, Raymond became a prominent voice in the open source movement. He co-founded the ,Open Source Initiative, in 1998, taking on the self-appointed role of ambassador of ,open source, to the press, business and public. He remains active in OSI, and stepped down as president of the initiative in February 2005.,[11], In 1998 Raymond received and published a Microsoft document expressing worry about the quality of rival open-source software.,[12], Raymond named this document, together with others subsequently leaked, "",the ,Halloween Documents,"".
,In 2000–2002 he created ,Configuration Menu Language 2, (CML2), a source code configuration system; while originally intended for the ,Linux operating system,, it was rejected by kernel developers.,[13], Raymond attributed this rejection to ""kernel list politics"".,[14], ,Linus Torvalds, on the other hand said in a 2007 mailing list ,post, that as a matter of policy, the development team preferred more incremental changes. His 2003 book ,The Art of Unix Programming, discusses user tools for programming and other tasks.
,Raymond is currently the administrator of the project page for the ,Global Positioning System, data tool ,gpsd,.,[15], Also, some versions of ,NetHack, include his guide.,[2], He has also contributed code and content to the free software video game ,The Battle for Wesnoth,.,[16],
,Raymond is also the main developer on ,NTPSec,, a ""secure, hardened replacement"" for the Unix utility ,NTP,.,[17],
,
,Views on open source,[,edit,],
,Raymond coined an ,aphorism, he dubbed ,Linus's law,, inspired by ,Linus Torvalds,: ""Given enough eyeballs, all ,bugs, are shallow"".,[18], It first appeared in his book ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar,.,[19],:,30,
,Raymond has refused to speculate on whether the ""bazaar"" development model could be applied to works such as books and music, saying that he does not want to ""weaken the winning argument for open-sourcing software by tying it to a potential loser"".,[20],
,Raymond has had a number of public ,disputes, with other figures in the ,free software movement,. As head of the Open Source Initiative, he argued that advocates should focus on the potential for better products. The ""very seductive"" moral and ethical rhetoric of ,Richard Stallman, and the ,Free Software Foundation, fails, he said, ""not because his principles are wrong, but because that kind of language ... simply does not persuade anybody"".,[21],
,In a 2008 essay he ""defended the right of programmers to issue work under proprietary licenses because I think that if a programmer wants to write a program and sell it, it's neither my business nor anyone else's but his customer's what the terms of sale are"".,[22], In the same essay he also said that the ""logic of the system"" puts developers into ""dysfunctional roles"", with bad code the result.
,
,Political beliefs and activism,[,edit,],
,Raymond is a member of the ,Libertarian Party,. He is a ,gun rights, advocate.,[23], He has endorsed the open source firearms organization ,Defense Distributed,, calling them ""friends of freedom"" and writing ""I approve of any development that makes it more difficult for governments and criminals to monopolize the use of force. As 3D printers become less expensive and more ubiquitous, this could be a major step in the right direction."",[24],[25],
,In 2015 Raymond accused the ,Ada Initiative, and other ,women in tech, groups of attempting to entrap male open source leaders and accuse them of rape, saying ""Try to avoid even being alone, ever, because there is a chance that a 'women in tech' advocacy group is going to try to collect your scalp."",[26],[27],
,Raymond has claimed that ""Gays experimented with unfettered promiscuity in the 1970s and got AIDS as a consequence"", and that ""Police who react to a random black male behaving suspiciously who might be in the critical age range as though he is an near-imminent lethal threat, are being rational, not racist."",[28],[29], Progressive campaign The Great Slate was successful in raising funds for candidates in part by asking for contributions from tech workers in return for not posting similar quotes by Raymond. ,Matasano Security, employee and Great Slate fundraiser Thomas Ptacek said, ""I’ve been torturing Twitter with lurid Eric S. Raymond quotes for years. Every time I do, 20 people beg me to stop."" It is estimated that as of March 2018 over $30,000 has been raised in this way.,[30],

,Emacs, ,/,ˈ,iː,m,æ,k,s,/, or ,EMACS, (,Editor MACroS,),[3],[4],[5], is a family of ,text editors, that are characterized by their ,extensibility,.,[6], The manual for the most widely used variant,,[7], ,GNU Emacs,, describes it as ""the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor"".,[8],  Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s, and work on its direct descendant, GNU Emacs, continues actively as of 2020,[update],.
,Emacs has over 10,000 built-in commands and its ,user interface, allows the user to combine these commands into ,macros, to automate work. Implementations of Emacs typically feature a dialect of the ,Lisp, programming language that provides a deep extension capability, allowing users and developers to write new commands and applications for the editor. Extensions have been written to ,manage email,, ,files,, ,outlines,, and ,RSS, feeds,,[9], as well as clones of ,ELIZA,, ,Pong,, ,Conway's Life,, ,Snake, and ,Tetris,.,[10],
,The original EMACS was written in 1976 by ,David A. Moon, and ,Guy L. Steele Jr., as a set of Editor MACroS for the ,TECO, editor.,[2],[3],[4],[5],[11], It was inspired by the ideas of the TECO-macro editors TECMAC and TMACS.,[12],
,The most popular, and most ported, version of Emacs is GNU Emacs, which was created by ,Richard Stallman, for the ,GNU Project,.,[13], ,XEmacs, is a variant that ,branched, from GNU Emacs in 1991. GNU Emacs and XEmacs use similar Lisp dialects and are for the most part compatible with each other.
,Emacs is, along with ,vi,, one of the two main contenders in the traditional ,editor wars, of ,Unix, culture. Emacs is among the oldest ,free and open source, projects still under development.,[14],

,History,[,edit,],
,  ,Emacs was started by ,Guy L. Steele Jr., as a project to unify the many divergent ,TECO, command sets and key bindings at ,MIT,[4],
,  ,The interface of Emacs was influenced by the design of the ,Symbolics, ,space-cadet keyboard,[15],
,  ,Editing ,C, ,source code, in ,GNU Emacs,
,  ,Editing, compiling and executing ,C++, code from ,GNU Emacs,
,Emacs development began during the 1970s at the ,MIT AI Lab,, whose ,PDP-6, and ,PDP-10, computers used the ,Incompatible Timesharing System, (ITS) ,operating system, that featured a default ,line editor, known as ,Tape Editor and Corrector, (TECO). Unlike most modern text editors, TECO used separate modes in which the user would either add text, edit existing text, or display the document. One could not place characters directly into a document by typing them into TECO, but would instead enter a character ('i') in the TECO command language telling it to switch to input mode, enter the required characters, during which time the edited text was not displayed on the screen, and finally enter a character (<esc>) to switch the editor back to command mode. (A similar technique was used to allow overtyping.) This behavior is similar to that of the program ,ed,.
,Richard Stallman, visited the ,Stanford AI Lab, in 1972 or 1974 and saw the lab's ,E, editor, written by Fred Wright.,[16], He was impressed by the editor's intuitive ,WYSIWYG, (What You See Is What You Get) behavior, which has since become the default behavior of most modern text editors. He returned to MIT where Carl Mikkelsen, a ,hacker, at the AI Lab, had added to TECO a combined display/editing mode called ,Control-R, that allowed the screen display to be updated each time the user entered a keystroke. Stallman reimplemented this mode to run efficiently and then added a ,macro, feature to the TECO display-editing mode that allowed the user to redefine any keystroke to run a TECO program.,[5],
,E had another feature that TECO lacked: random-access editing. TECO was a page-sequential editor that was designed for editing ,paper tape, on the ,PDP-1, and typically allowed editing on only one page at a time, in the order of the pages in the file. Instead of adopting E's approach of structuring the file for page-random access on disk, Stallman modified TECO to handle large buffers more efficiently and changed its file-management method to read, edit, and write the entire file as a single buffer. Almost all modern editors use this approach.
,The new version of TECO quickly became popular at the AI Lab and soon accumulated a large collection of custom macros whose names often ended in ,MAC, or ,MACS,, which stood for ,macro,. Two years later, ,Guy Steele, took on the project of unifying the diverse macros into a single set.,[17], Steele and Stallman's finished implementation included facilities for extending and documenting the new macro set.,[5], The resulting system was called EMACS, which stood for ,Editing MACroS, or, alternatively, ,E with MACroS,. Stallman picked the name Emacs ""because <E> was not in use as an abbreviation on ITS at the time."",[18], An ,apocryphal, ,hacker koan, alleges that the program was named after ,Emack & Bolio's,, a popular ,Cambridge, ice cream store.,[19], The first operational EMACS system existed in late 1976.,[20],
,Stallman saw a problem in too much customization and ,de facto, forking and set certain conditions for usage.,[,citation needed,], He later wrote:,[20],

,The original Emacs, like TECO, ran only on the PDP-10 running ITS. Its behavior was sufficiently different from that of TECO that it could be considered a text editor in its own right, and it quickly became the standard editing program on ITS. ,Mike McMahon, ,ported, Emacs from ITS to the ,TENEX, and ,TOPS-20, operating systems. Other contributors to early versions of Emacs include ,Kent Pitman,, ,Earl Killian,, and ,Eugene Ciccarelli,. By 1979, Emacs was the main editor used in MIT's AI lab and its Laboratory for Computer Science.,[21],
,
,Implementations,[,edit,],
,Early implementations,[,edit,],
,  ,James Gosling, wrote the first Emacs-like editor to run on ,Unix, (,Gosling Emacs,) in 1981,
,In the following years, programmers wrote a variety of Emacs-like editors for other computer systems. These included ,EINE, (,EINE Is Not EMACS,) and ,ZWEI,[22], (,ZWEI Was EINE Initially,), which were written for the ,Lisp machine, by ,Mike McMahon, and ,Daniel Weinreb,, and Sine (,Sine Is Not Eine,),,[23], which was written by Owen Theodore Anderson. Weinreb's ,EINE, was the first Emacs written in Lisp. In 1978, ,Bernard Greenberg, wrote ,Multics Emacs, almost entirely in Multics Lisp at ,Honeywell,'s Cambridge Information Systems Lab. Multics Emacs was later maintained by ,Richard Soley,, who went on to develop the NILE Emacs-like editor for the NIL Project, and by Barry Margolin. Many versions of Emacs, including GNU Emacs, would later adopt Lisp as an extension language.
,James Gosling,, who would later invent ,NeWS, and the ,Java programming language,, wrote ,Gosling Emacs, in 1981. The first Emacs-like editor to run on ,Unix,, Gosling Emacs was written in ,C, and used ,Mocklisp,, a language with Lisp-like syntax, as an extension language.
,
,GNU Emacs,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,GNU Emacs,
,  ,GNU Emacs, running in a ,text console,
,  ,GNU Emacs running on ,Microsoft Windows,
,Richard Stallman began work on GNU Emacs in 1984 to produce a ,free software, alternative to the proprietary Gosling Emacs. GNU Emacs was initially based on Gosling Emacs, but Stallman's replacement of its Mocklisp interpreter with a true Lisp interpreter required that nearly all of its code be rewritten. This became the first program released by the nascent GNU Project. GNU Emacs is written in ,C, and provides ,Emacs Lisp,, also implemented in C, as an extension language. Version 13, the first public release, was made on March 20, 1985. The first widely distributed version of GNU Emacs was version 15.34, released later in 1985. Early versions of GNU Emacs were numbered as ,1.x.x,, with the initial digit denoting the version of the C core. The ,1, was dropped after version 1.12, as it was thought that the major number would never change, and thus the numbering skipped from ,1, to ,13,.,[24], In September 2014, it was announced on the GNU emacs-devel mailing list that GNU Emacs would adopt a ,rapid release, strategy and version numbers would increment more quickly in the future.,[25],
,GNU Emacs was later ported to Unix. It offered more features than Gosling Emacs, in particular a full-featured Lisp as its extension language, and soon replaced Gosling Emacs as the ,de facto, Unix Emacs editor. ,Markus Hess, exploited a security flaw in GNU Emacs' email subsystem in his 1986 cracking spree in which he gained ,superuser, access to Unix computers.,[26],
,Most of GNU Emacs functionality is implemented through a ,scripting language, called ,Emacs Lisp,. Because about 70% of GNU Emacs is written in the Elisp extension language,,[27], one only needs to port the C core which implements the Elisp interpreter. This makes porting Emacs to a new platform considerably less difficult than porting an equivalent project consisting of native code only.
,GNU Emacs development was relatively closed until 1999 and was used as an example of the ,Cathedral, development style in ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar,. The project has since adopted a public development mailing list and anonymous ,CVS, access. Development took place in a single CVS trunk until 2008 and was then switched to the Bazaar ,DVCS,. On November 11, 2014, development was moved to ,Git,.,[28],
,Richard Stallman has remained the principal maintainer of GNU Emacs, but he has stepped back from the role at times. Stefan Monnier and Chong Yidong were maintainers from 2008 to 2015.,[29],[30], John Wiegley was named maintainer in 2015 after a meeting with Stallman at MIT.,[31], As of early 2014, GNU Emacs has had 579 individual ,committers, throughout its history.,[32],
,
,XEmacs,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,XEmacs,
,  ,XEmacs, 21.5 on ,GNU,/,Linux,
,Lucid Emacs, based on an early alpha version of GNU Emacs 19, was developed beginning in 1991 by ,Jamie Zawinski, and others at ,Lucid Inc., One of the best-known early forks in ,free software, development occurred when the codebases of the two Emacs versions diverged and the separate development teams ceased efforts to merge them back into a single program.,[33], Lucid Emacs has since been renamed ,XEmacs,. Its development has slowed, with the most recent stable version 21.4.22 released in January 2009 (while a beta was released in 2013), while GNU Emacs has implemented many formerly XEmacs-only features.,[34],[,better source needed,],
,
,Other forks of GNU Emacs,[,edit,],
,Other notable forks include:
,
,Aquamacs, – based on GNU Emacs (Aquamacs 3.2 is based on GNU Emacs version 24 and Aquamacs 3.3 is based on GNU Emacs version 25) which focuses on integrating with the Apple Macintosh user interface,
,Meadow, – a Japanese version for Microsoft Windows,[35],
,SXEmacs, – Steve Youngs' fork of XEmacs,[36],
,Various Emacs editors,[,edit,],
,  ,uEmacs/Pk, 4.0.15 on Linux,
,  ,The ,mg, tiny Emacs-like editor in ,OpenBSD, 5.3. Editing ,Ruby, ,source code,
,  ,JOVE, running in a ,Debian, box,
,  ,Zmacs,, an Emacs for ,Lisp machines,
,In the past, projects aimed at producing small versions of Emacs proliferated. GNU Emacs was initially targeted at computers with a 32-bit flat address space and at least 1 ,MiB, of RAM.,[37],  Such computers were high end ,workstations, and ,minicomputers, in the 1980s, and this left a need for smaller reimplementations that would run on common ,personal computer, hardware.  Today's computers have more than enough power and capacity to eliminate these restrictions, but small clones have more recently been designed to fit on software installation disks or for use on less capable hardware.,[38],
,Other projects aim to implement Emacs in a different dialect of Lisp or a different programming language altogether.  Although not all are still actively maintained, these clones include:
,
,MicroEMACS,, which was originally written by Dave Conroy and further developed by Daniel Lawrence and which exists in many variations.,
,mg,, originally called MicroGNUEmacs and, later, mg2a, a public-domain offshoot of MicroEMACS intended to more closely resemble GNU Emacs. Now installed by default on ,OpenBSD,.,
,JOVE, (Jonathan's Own Version of Emacs), Jonathan Payne's non-programmable Emacs implementation for ,UNIX-like, systems.,
,MINCE, (MINCE Is Not Complete Emacs), a version for CP/M and later DOS, from ,Mark of the Unicorn,. MINCE evolved into Final Word, which eventually became the Borland ,Sprint, word processor.,
,Perfect Writer,, a ,CP/M, implementation derived from MINCE that was included circa 1982 as the default word processor with the very earliest releases of the Kaypro II and Kaypro IV. It was later provided with the Kaypro 10 as an alternative to ,WordStar,.,
,Freemacs,, a ,DOS, version that uses an extension language based on text macro expansion and fits within the original 64 ,KiB, flat memory limit.,
,Zile,. Zile was a recursive acronym for ,Z,ile ,I,s ,L,ossy, ,E,macs,,,[39], but the project was rewritten in ,Lua, and now gives the expansion as Zile Implements Lua Editors. The new Zile still includes an implementation of Emacs in Lua called Zemacs. There is also an implementation of vi called Zi.,
,Zmacs,, for the MIT ,Lisp Machine, and its descendants, implemented in ,ZetaLisp,.,
,Climacs,, a Zmacs-influenced variant implemented in ,Common Lisp,.,
,Epsilon,,,[40], an Emacs clone by Lugaru Software. Versions for DOS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and O/S 2 are bundled in the release. It uses a non-Lisp extension language with C syntax and used a very early concurrent command shell buffer implementation under the single-tasking MS-DOS.,
,PceEmacs, is the Emacs-based editor for ,SWI-Prolog,.,
,Amacs,, an Apple II ProDOS version of Emacs implemented in 6502 assembly by ,Brian Fox,.,[41],[42],
,Hemlock,, originally written in ,Spice Lisp,, then ,Common Lisp,. A part of ,CMU Common Lisp,. Influenced by ,Zmacs,. Later forked by Lucid Common Lisp (as Helix), ,LispWorks, and ,Clozure CL, projects. There is also a Portable Hemlock project, which aims to provide a Hemlock, which runs on several Common Lisp implementations.,
,umacs,,,[43], an implementation under ,OS-9,
,Editors with Emacs emulation,[,edit,],
,Joe's Own Editor, emulates Emacs keybindings when invoked as ,jmacs,.,
,JED, has an emulation mode for Emacs.,
,Eclipse (IDE), provides a set of Emacs keybindings.,
,IntelliJ IDEA, provides a set of Emacs keybindings.,
,Epsilon (text editor), Defaults to Emacs emulation and supports a vi mode.,
,The ,Cocoa text system, uses some of the same terminology and understands many Emacs navigation bindings. This is possible because the native UI uses the ,Command key, (equivalent to Super) instead of the ,Control key,.,[44],
,GNU Readline, is a ,line editor, that understands the standard Emacs navigation keybindings. It also has a ,vi, emulation mode.,
,GNOME Builder, has an emulation mode for Emacs.,
,MATLAB, provides Emacs keybindings for its editor.,[45],
,Features,[,edit,],
,Emacs is primarily a ,text editor, and is designed for manipulating pieces of text, although it is capable of formatting and printing documents like a ,word processor, by interfacing with external programs such as ,LaTeX,, ,Ghostscript, or a web browser. Emacs provides commands to manipulate and ,differentially display, ,semantic, units of text such as ,words,, ,sentences,, ,paragraphs, and ,source code, constructs such as ,functions,. It also features ,keyboard macros, for performing user-defined batches of editing commands.
,GNU Emacs is a ,real-time display, editor, as its edits are displayed onscreen as they occur. This is standard behavior for modern text editors but EMACS was among the earliest to implement this functionality instead of having to issue a separate command to insert new edits into the existing text as in vi.
,
,General architecture,[,edit,],
,Almost all of the functionality in Emacs, including basic editing operations such as the insertion of characters into a document, is achieved through ,functions, written in a dialect of the ,Lisp programming language,. The dialect used in GNU Emacs is known as ,Emacs Lisp, (ELisp). The ELisp layer sits atop a stable core of basic services and platform abstraction written in the ,C programming language,. In this Lisp environment, ,variables, and ,functions, can be modified with no need to recompile or restart Emacs.
,Emacs operates on ,data structures, called ,buffers, containing text with additional attributes; every buffer maintains its own ,point, (cursor location) and ,mark, (another location, delimiting the selected ,region, together with the ,point,), the name of the file it is ,visiting, (if applicable) and the set of active ,modes, (exactly one ,major mode,[,clarification needed,], and any number of ,minor modes,[,clarification needed,],), which control editor behaviour through variables. Elisp code can be executed interactively through named ,commands,, which can be bound to key presses or accessed by name; some commands evaluate arbitrary Elisp code from buffers (e.g. ,eval-region, or ,eval-buffer,).
,Buffers are displayed in ,windows,, which are tiled portions of the terminal screen or the GUI window (called a ,frame, in Emacs terms; multiple frames are possible). Unless configured otherwise, windows include scroll bars, line numbers, a ,header line, at the top (usually displaying the buffer title or filename) and a ,mode line, at the bottom (usually listing the active modes and point position of the buffer).
,Multiple windows can be opened onto the same buffer, for example to see different parts of a long text, and multiple buffers can share the same text, for example to take advantage of different major modes in a mixed-language file. The mode can also be changed manually as needed with ,M-x <mode name>,.
,
,Customizability,[,edit,],
,Keystrokes can be recorded into macros and replayed to automate complex, repetitive tasks. This is often done on an ad-hoc basis, with each macro discarded after use, although macros can be saved and invoked later.,
,At startup, Emacs executes an Emacs Lisp script named ,.mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace},~/.emacs, (recent versions also look for ,~/emacs.el, and ,~/.emacs.d/init.el,;,[46], Emacs will execute the first one it finds, ignoring the rest). This personal customization file can be arbitrarily long and complex, but typical content includes:
,Setting global variables or invoking functions to customize Emacs behaviour, for example ,(set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8),
,Key bindings, to override standard ones and to add shortcuts for commands that the user finds convenient but don't have a key binding by default. Example: ,(,global-set-key, ,(,kbd, ,""C-x C-b"",), ,'ibuffer,),
,Loading, enabling and initializing extensions (Emacs comes with many extensions, but only a few are loaded by default.),
,Configuring ,event hooks, to run arbitrary code at specific times, for example to automatically recompile source code after saving a buffer (,after-save-hook,),
,Executing arbitrary files, usually to split an overly long configuration file into manageable and homogeneous parts (,~/.emacs.d/, and ,~/elisp/, are traditional locations for these personal scripts),
,The ,customize, extension allows the user to set configuration properties such as the color scheme interactively, from within Emacs, in a more user-friendly way than by setting variables in ,.emacs,: it offers search, descriptions and help text, multiple choice inputs, reverting to defaults, modification of the running Emacs instance without reloading, and other conveniences similar to the ,preferences, functionality of other programs. The customized values are saved in ,.emacs, (or another designated file) automatically.,
,Themes,, affecting the choice of fonts and colours, are defined as elisp files and chosen through the customize extension.,
,Self-documenting,[,edit,],
,The first Emacs contained a ,help, library that included documentation for every command, variable and internal function. Because of this, Emacs proponents described the software as ,self-documenting, in that it presents the user with information on its normal features and its current state. Each function includes a documentation string that is displayed to the user on request, a practice that subsequently spread to programming languages including ,Lisp,, ,Java,, ,Perl,, and ,Python,. This help system can take users to the actual code for each function, whether from a built-in library or an added third-party library.
,Emacs also has a built-in ,tutorial,. Emacs displays instructions for performing simple editing commands and invoking the tutorial when it is launched with no file to edit. The tutorial is by Stuart Cracraft and Richard Stallman.
,
,Culture,[,edit,],
,Church of Emacs,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Editor war,
,  ,Richard Stallman, as St I,GNUcius,, a saint in the ,Church of Emacs,
,The ,Church of Emacs,, formed by ,Richard Stallman,, is a ,parody religion, created for Emacs users.,[47], While it refers to ,vi, as the ,editor of the beast, (vi-vi-vi being ,6-6-6, in Roman numerals), it does not oppose the use of vi; rather, it calls it ,proprietary software, ,anathema,. (""Using a ,free, version of vi is not a sin but a ,penance,."",[48],) The Church of Emacs has its own ,newsgroup,, ,alt.religion.emacs,,,[49], that has posts purporting to support this parody religion. Supporters of vi have created an opposing ,Cult of vi,.
,Stallman has jokingly referred to himself as ,St I ,GNU, cius,, a saint in the Church of Emacs.,[50],
,
,Emacs pinky,[,edit,],
,There is folklore attributing a ,repetitive strain injury, colloquially called ,Emacs ,pinky, to Emacs' strong dependence on modifier keys,,[51], although there have not been any studies done to show Emacs causes more such problems than other keyboard-heavy computer programs.
,Users have addressed this through various approaches. Some users recommend simply using the two Control keys on typical PC keyboards like Shift keys while touch typing to avoid overly straining the left pinky.,[52], Software-side methods include:,[53],
,
,Customizing the key layout so that the Control key is transposed with the caps lock key.,[54], Similar techniques include defining the caps lock key as an additional Control key or transposing the Control and Meta keys.,However, as these keys are still pressed with the same finger, they may still contribute to Emacs pinky.,[,clarification needed,],
,Software, such as xwrits or the built-in ,type-break-mode, in Emacs, that reminds the user to take regularly scheduled breaks.,
,Using the ErgoEmacs keybindings (with minor mode ,ergoemacs-mode,).,[55],
,Customizing the whole keyboard layout to move statistically frequent Emacs keys to more appropriate places.,[56],
,Packages such as ,ace-jump-mode,[57], or elisp extensions that provide similar functionality of tiered navigation, first asking for a character then replacing occurrences of the character with access keys for cursor movement.,
,evil-mode,, an advanced ,Vim, emulation layer.,
,god-mode,, which provides an approach similar to vim's with a mode for entering Emacs commands without modifier keys.,
,Using customized key layout offered by ,Spacemacs,, a project where ,Space, key is used as the main key for initiating control sequences. The project also heavily incorporates both ,evil-mode, and ,god-mode,.,[58],
,StickyKeys,, which turns key sequences into key combinations.,[59],
,Emacs' built-in ,viper-mode, that allows use of the ,vi, key layout for basic text editing and the Emacs scheme for more advanced features.,[60],
,Giving a dual role to a more-comfortably accessed key such as the ,Space bar, so that it functions as a Control key when pressed in combination with other keys. ,Ergonomic keyboards, or keyboards with a greater number of keys adjacent to the space bar, such as ,Japanese keyboards,, allow thumb control of other modifier keys too like Meta or Shift.,[61],
,Using a limited ergonomic subset of keybindings, and accessing other functionality by typing ,M-x <command-name>,. M-x itself can also be rebound.,
,Driving Emacs through voice input.,
,Hardware solutions include special keyboards such as ,Kinesis's Contoured Keyboard,, which places the modifier keys where they can easily be operated by the ,thumb,, or the ,Microsoft Natural keyboard,, whose large modifier keys are placed symmetrically on both sides of the keyboard and can be pressed with the palm of the hand.,[51], Foot pedals can also be used.
,The ,Emacs pinky, is a relatively recent development. The ,Space-cadet keyboard, on which Emacs was developed had oversized Control keys that were adjacent to the space bar and were easy to reach with the thumb.,[62],
,
,Terminology,[,edit,],
,The word ,emacs, is sometimes pluralized as ,emacsen,, by phonetic analogy with ,boxen, and ,VAXen,, referring to different varieties of Emacs.,[63],

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development),"  ,A timeline chart of how ,Linux distributions, have forked.,
,In ,software engineering,, a ,project fork, happens when developers take a copy of ,source code, from one ,software package, and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a ,development branch,, but also a split in the developer community, a form of ,schism,.,[1],
,Free and open-source software, is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission, without violating ,copyright, law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software (,e.g., ,Unix,) also happen.

,Etymology,[,edit,],
,The word ""fork"" has been used to mean ""to divide in branches, go separate ways"" as early as the 14th century.,[2], In the software environment, the word evokes the ,fork, system call, which causes a running process to split itself into two (almost) identical copies that (typically) diverge to perform different tasks.,[3],
,In the context of software development, ""fork"" was used in the sense of creating a revision control "",branch,"" by ,Eric Allman, as early as 1980, in the context of ,SCCS,:,[4],

,The term was in use on ,Usenet, by 1983 for the process of creating a subgroup to move topics of discussion to.,[5],
,""Fork"" is not known to have been used in the sense of a community schism during the origins of Lucid Emacs (now ,XEmacs,) (1991) or the ,BSDs, (1993–1994); ,Russ Nelson, used the term ""shattering"" for this sort of fork in 1993, attributing it to ,John Gilmore,.,[6], However, ""fork"" was in use in the present sense by 1995 to describe the XEmacs split,,[7], and was an understood usage in the ,GNU, Project by 1996.,[8],
,
,Forking of free and open-source software,[,edit,],
,Free and open-source software may be legally forked without prior approval of those currently developing, managing, or distributing the software per both ,The Free Software Definition, and ,The Open Source Definition,:,[9],
,
,The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.,— ,The Free Software Definition,[10],
,3. Derived Works: The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.,— ,The Open Source Definition,[11],
,In free software, forks often result from a schism over different goals or personality clashes. In a fork, both parties assume nearly identical code bases, but typically only the larger group, or whoever controls the Web site, will retain the full original name and the associated user community. Thus, there is a reputation penalty associated with forking.,[9], The relationship between the different teams can be cordial or very bitter. On the other hand, a ,friendly fork, or a ,soft fork, is a fork that does not intend to compete, but wants to eventually merge with the original.
,Eric S. Raymond,, in his essay ,Homesteading the Noosphere,,,[12], stated that ""The most important characteristic of a fork is that it spawns competing projects that cannot later exchange code, splitting the potential developer community"". He notes in the ,Jargon File,:,[13],
,
,Forking is considered a Bad Thing—not merely because it implies a lot of wasted effort in the future, but because forks tend to be accompanied by a great deal of strife and acrimony between the successor groups over issues of legitimacy, succession, and design direction. There is serious social pressure against forking. As a result, major forks (such as the ,Gnu-Emacs,/,XEmacs, split, the fissioning of the ,386BSD, group into three daughter projects, and the short-lived GCC/EGCS split) are rare enough that they are remembered individually in hacker folklore.,
,David A. Wheeler notes,[9], four possible outcomes of a fork, with examples:
,
,The death of the fork. This is by far the most common case. It is easy to declare a fork, but considerable effort to continue independent development and support.,
,A re-merging of the fork (,e.g.,, ,egcs, becoming ""blessed"" as the new version of ,gcc,.),
,The death of the original (,e.g., the ,X.Org Server, succeeding and ,XFree86, dying.),
,Successful branching, typically with differentiation (,e.g.,, ,OpenBSD, and ,NetBSD,.),
,Distributed revision control, (DVCS) tools have popularised a less emotive use of the term ""fork"", blurring the distinction with ""branch"".,[14], With a DVCS such as ,Mercurial, or ,Git,, the normal way to contribute to a project, is to first create a personal branch of the repository, independent of the main repository, and later seek to have your changes integrated with it. Sites such as ,GitHub,, ,Bitbucket, and ,Launchpad, provide free DVCS hosting expressly supporting independent branches, such that the technical, social and financial barriers to forking a source code repository are massively reduced, and GitHub uses ""fork"" as its term for this method of contribution to a project.
,Forks often restart version numbering from 0.1 or 1.0 even if the original software was at version 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0. An exception is when the forked software is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the original project, ,e.g., ,MariaDB, for ,MySQL,[15], or ,LibreOffice, for ,OpenOffice.org,.
,
,Forking proprietary software,[,edit,],
,In ,proprietary software,, the copyright is usually held by the employing entity, not by the individual software developers. Proprietary code is thus more commonly forked when the owner needs to develop two or more versions, such as a ,windowed, version and a ,command line, version, or versions for differing operating systems, such as a ,word processor, for ,IBM PC, compatible machines and ,Macintosh, computers. Generally, such internal forks will concentrate on having the same look, feel, data format, and behavior between platforms so that a user familiar with one can also be productive or share documents generated on the other. This is almost always an economic decision to generate a greater ,market share, and thus pay back the associated extra development costs created by the fork.
,A notable proprietary fork not of this kind is the many varieties of proprietary ,Unix,—almost all derived from AT&T Unix under license and all called ""Unix"", but increasingly mutually incompatible.,[16], ,See, ,UNIX wars,.
,The ,BSD licenses, permit forks to become proprietary software, and ,copyleft, proponents say that commercial incentives thus make proprietisation almost inevitable. (Copyleft licenses can, however, be circumvented via dual-licensing with a proprietary grant in the form of a ,Contributor License Agreement,.) Examples include ,macOS, (based on the proprietary ,NeXTSTEP, and the open source ,FreeBSD,), ,Cedega, and ,CrossOver, (proprietary forks of ,Wine,, though CrossOver tracks Wine and contributes considerably), EnterpriseDB (a fork of ,PostgreSQL,, adding Oracle compatibility features,[17],), Supported PostgreSQL with their proprietary ESM storage system,,[18], and Netezza's,[19], proprietary highly scalable derivative of PostgreSQL. Some of these vendors contribute back changes to the community project, while some keep their changes as their own competitive advantages.
