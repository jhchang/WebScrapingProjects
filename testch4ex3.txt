TITLE: U.S. prosecutor who has investigated Trump lawyer refuses to resign
BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. federal prosecutor whose office has been investigating President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, refused to step down after the administration abruptly said late on Friday it was replacing him. The standoff marks the latest in a series of unusual actions by Attorney General William Barr that critics say are meant to benefit Trump politically and undermine the independence of the Justice Department.  It also comes as Trump seeks to purge officials perceived as not fully supporting him. In recent weeks he has fired a series of agency watchdogs, including one who played a key role in Trump’s impeachment earlier this year. Barr, in a surprise late-night announcement, said the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, was stepping down and that Trump would nominate Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton to take Berman’s spot. Berman, who leads a powerful office known for prosecuting terrorism cases, Wall Street financial crimes and government corruption, said he first learned of the move from Barr’s press release and would not go quietly. “I have not resigned, and have no intention of resigning my position,” Berman said in a statement. “I will step down when a presidentially appointed nominee is confirmed by the Senate. Until then, our investigations will move forward without delay or interruption.”     A Justice Department official, asked about Berman’s refusal to leave until a successor is confirmed, told Reuters the “timeline remains the same” as Barr laid out in announcing the replacement.  The move seemed to surprise the chairman of the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham, who said on Saturday he had not been contacted by the administration. In a statement, Graham said Clayton’s nomination would still be required to go through the usual practice of getting approvals from his home-state senators, in this case Democrats Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. “As chairman, I have honored that policy and will continue to do so,” Graham said. That approval looked unlikely to be forthcoming, with Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, saying in a statement Clayton should withdraw his name from consideration, “and save his own reputation from overnight ruin.” Gillibrand said in a statement that she would not be complicit in helping Trump and Barr fire a U.S. Attorney who is reportedly investigating corruption in Trump’s administration, and that Clayton should “remove himself from this sham.” FILE PHOTO: U.S. Attorney for the Southern District Geoffrey S.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File PhotoHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, also a Democrat, said he intends to invite Berman to testify. Since being appointed in January 2018, Berman has not shied from taking on figures in Trump’s orbit. His office oversaw the prosecution of Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer, indicted two Giuliani associates and launched a probe into Giuliani in connection with his efforts to dig up dirt on Trump’s political adversaries in Ukraine. Prosecutors have not accused Giuliani of wrongdoing. TIMING QUESTIONED  The move against Berman came as the Justice Department asked a federal court to block publication of a book by former National Security Adviser John Bolton, whose claims include an allegation Trump tried to interfere with a probe overseen by Berman’s office. On Saturday, a U.S. judge denied the administration’s request to block publication. Berman replaced Preet Bharara, who was himself fired as U.S. Attorney in early 2017 soon after Trump became president. Bharara, an outspoken critic of the president, said the timing of the push to replace his successor was strange.  “Why does a president get rid of his own hand-picked US Attorney in SDNY on a Friday night, less than 5 months before the election?” Bharara wrote on Twitter, referring to the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election. Meanwhile, Trump has appointed Craig Carpenito, the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, as the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Barr said in his statement. It was not clear whether Barr can force Berman out. Berman was never confirmed by the Senate, the usual process for appointing U.S. Attorneys, and was instead appointed by the judges of the district in accordance with a U.S. law that says he can serve until the vacancy is filled. Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said the vacancy needs to be filled by someone who is Senate-confirmed or chosen by a judge. Carpenito, Vladeck wrote on Twitter, is neither of those. But Vladeck also cited a conflicting law that gives the president the authority to remove U.S. Attorneys.  Before Clayton joined the SEC, he was a lawyer specializing in mergers and acquisitions at Sullivan & Cromwell. He has been seen as a bipartisan consensus-builder at the SEC. Slideshow (2 Images)The Justice Department official said Clayton, who had been planning to leave the administration and return to New York, “expressed interest” in the U.S. Attorney role in New York, and Barr “thought it was a good idea.” Barr’s announcement comes less than a week before Nadler’s committee is set to hold a hearing where Justice Department officials are set to testify about political interference at the department.  Earlier this year, Barr intervened to scale back the sentencing recommendation for longtime Trump ally Roger Stone, prompting all four career prosecutors to withdraw from the case in protest.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Saturday denied a request by the Trump administration for an injunction to block publication of a book by President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton that alleges the president sought China’s help to win re-election. FILE PHOTO: Former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton adjusts his glasses during his lecture at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, U.S. February 17, 2020.   REUTERS/Jonathan Drake/File Photo“While Bolton’s unilateral conduct raises grave national security concerns, the government has not established that an injunction is an appropriate remedy,” U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said in his ruling. The administration had sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the publication of “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,” saying it contained classified information and threatened national security. The book, scheduled to hit store shelves on Tuesday, is already in the hands of media organizations. “Defendant Bolton has gambled with the national security of the United States. He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability,” the judge wrote. But he said an injunction would be too late to stem the harm. “With hundreds of thousands of copies around the globe —many in newsrooms — the damage is done,” Lamberth said.In a post on Twitter shortly after the decision, Trump charged again that Bolton was releasing classified information. “He must pay a very big price for this, as others have before him,” Trump said.  He latched on to the judge’s rebuke of Bolton. “BIG COURT WIN against Bolton,” Trump said.  A civil suit is pending against Bolton.  Publishers Simon & Schuster and Bolton’s lawyer Charles Cooper welcomed the ruling. “We respectfully take issue, however, with the Court’s preliminary conclusion at this early stage of the case that Ambassador Bolton did not comply fully with his contractual prepublication obligation to the Government, and the case will now proceed to development of the full record on that issue,” Cooper said in a statement.  Bolton’s book has drawn wide attention for its withering portrayal of Trump. Bolton describes Trump as imploring Chinese President Xi Jinping for help in winning his 2020 re-election bid, and he detailed alleged improprieties not addressed in Trump’s impeachment trial.  Trump ousted Bolton, a foreign policy hawk, last September after 17 months as national security adviser.

TITLE: Ousting of U.S. prosecutor thrusts low-profile markets regulator into unwelcome spotlight
BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Friday’s surprise bid by the U.S. Department of Justice to replace a top federal prosecutor has thrust one of the Trump administration’s more low-profile officials into a partisan storm which he is likely to try to quickly exit, said those who know him. FILE PHOTO: Jay Clayton, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, speaks at the Economic Club of New York luncheon in New York City, New York, U.S.,September 9, 2019. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File PhotoOver the past 12 hours, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton has come under enormous pressure to withdraw his nomination to replace U.S. Attorney in Manhattan Geoffrey Berman after he made it clear he was being ousted. In his post at the Southern District of New York (SDNY), Berman has led the prosecution of high profile corruption and Wall Street crimes, and been investigating President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani. “Clayton can allow himself to be used in the brazen Trump-Barr scheme to interfere in investigations by the U.S. Attorney for SDNY, or he can stand up to this corruption, withdraw his name from consideration, and save his own reputation from overnight ruin,” Schumer tweeted on Saturday. Clayton’s nomination for the SDNY role stunned former SEC officials and industry insiders who have worked with Clayton, a former corporate lawyer and political independent who has steered well clear of partisan controversy during his tenure.  “Given the controversy, I think he will bow out,” said J.W. Verret, a securities law professor at George Mason University who said he knows Clayton from his work on the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee. He described Clayton as “mild-mannered” and said he has “played it straight up the middle” at SEC. While Clayton has been criticized by Democrats and consumer advocates for pushing the Trump administration’s agenda to cut red tape, he is generally respected for his expertise and described by those who deal with him as thoughtful and affable. “He says what he means and he follows through on what he says. And he cares deeply about the American public,” said Scott Bauguess, a University of Texas professor and former SEC official. “It is not clear to me that he is the right person for the SDNY job if the objective is to do the President’s bidding against his own judgment.” Clayton could not be reached for comment on Saturday. His spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  In an email Clayton sent to staff just after midnight on Friday, seen by Reuters, the SEC chair said it was “a great honor to be considered for this important position” and that he remained “fully committed” to SEC work pending his confirmation. Three people with knowledge of Clayton’s thinking said the SEC chair, whose role is based in Washington DC, had been on the lookout for a senior government post based back in New York where he was based prior to joining the SEC. But they and other white collar attorneys who know Clayton said they thought he would no longer want the role now Berman had made it clear he was being ousted. Verret speculated that Clayton may not have had all the facts when agreeing to be nominated. “I really think Clayton is going to do the right thing here … I’ve gotten to know him a bit and I just don’t think he would put up with what appears to be nefarious intent,” he added.

WASHINGTON/TULSA, Okla. (Reuters) - Amid a still-strong pandemic and after weeks of protests about racial inequality, President Donald Trump will hold a rally with thousands of supporters in Oklahoma on Saturday in an effort to reinvigorate his re-election campaign. An armed woman sells T-shirts, a day before a rally by U.S. President Donald Trump, near the BOK Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, U.S. June 19, 2020. REUTERS/Goran TomasevicTrump has come under fire for his responses to the coronavirus and to the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in the custody of Minneapolis police.  He drew more criticism for his decision to hold his first rally since schools and businesses were shut in March to stop the spread of coronavirus in Tulsa, the site here of the country's bloodiest outbreaks of racist violence against black Americans some 100 years ago. Oklahoma has reported a surge in new COVID-19 infections in recent days, and the state’s department of health has warned that attendees at the 19,000-seat BOK Center venue face an increased risk of catching the virus.  The Republican president is trailing presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, in polls ahead of the November election.  Supporters are delighted to see Trump back on the campaign trail, and those wanting to attend far outstripped the number of seats available, Trump campaign officials said.  Mike Boatman, 52, said he arrived in Tulsa from southern Indiana on Monday to ensure he secured his spot. “Over one million tickets being requested for this, so I wanted to be here early,” Boatman said. “This ain’t nothing. I mean, what our president does for us every day, he sacrifices for us, every one of us, no matter who we are, whether we are Black, white, Asian, yellow. He don’t care.” The country’s racial divide remains a political vulnerability. Trump’s “law and order” reaction to the protests triggered by Floyd’s death has put him at odds with the views of most Americans. After intense criticism, Trump postponed the rally by a day so that it did not coincide with the anniversary of the June 19 commemoration of the end of Black slavery in the United States. On Friday, he threatened unspecified action against any “protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes” who traveled to Oklahoma, a warning that his campaign said was not aimed at peaceful demonstrators. Critics accused Trump of trying to provoke conflict. White House and Trump campaign officials have largely dismissed concerns about the rally’s safety, saying masks and hand sanitizer will be available. However, participants are required to waive their right sue if they contract the coronavirus at the event. Outside the venue, Michigan resident Saundra Kiczenski, 40, said this would be her 36th Trump rally and her 19th state. She wondered how public health concerns would change things. Related CoverageSix members of Trump's campaign team test positive for COVID-19“Are they going to have, like chairs on the floor, like spread out like that? Are they going to have everybody together like we were?” Kiczenski asked. “It’s kind of a different thing for everybody - come to this one and then see how things are going to change going to November.”  Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale told Fox News on Friday that he would probably wear a mask to the rally, while White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told reporters she would not. Trump has eschewed wearing a mask in public. Strategists and former administrations officials say Trump must convince voters that his policies will pull the United States out of the recession sparked by the economic shutdown amid the outbreak.

REUTERS/George Frey/File Photo(Reuters) - The U.S. National Institutes of Health said on Saturday it has halted a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The study found that hydroxychloroquine, which President Donald Trump has frequently touted a possible treatment, did not provide any benefit to the patients, even though it did no harm, NIH said in a statement. Earlier this week, the World Health Organization said testing of hydroxychloroquine in its large multi-country trial of treatments for COVID-19 patients had been halted after new data and studies showed no benefit. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration revoked its emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 on Monday. Trump had promoted the drug as a potential treatment, saying in March it could turn out to be “one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine” when used in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin. Last month, in a surprise announcement, Trump said he was taking a course of hydroxychloroquine as a preventative after two White House aides tested positive for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. NIH announced its trial of hydroxychloroquine, which is used to treat malaria and rheumatoid conditions such as arthritis, in April.

REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage(Reuters) - A 29-year-old woman has been identified as a suspect in setting fire to the Wendy’s restaurant in Atlanta where police shot and killed Rayshard Brooks a week ago, the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department said on Saturday. Investigators have issued an arrest warrant for Natalie White on suspicion of arson in the first degree, the fire department said in a statement. She is suspected of involvement in the torching of the restaurant on June 13 as protests erupted after Brooks, a 27-year-old Black man, was fatally shot by a white police officer. The investigation is ongoing and officials are seeking information on White’s whereabouts and any other details about the incident, the statement said.  The Wendy’s parking lot was the scene of Brooks’ death on June 12 when police responded to a 911 call that he had fallen asleep in his car in the drive-through lane. Caught on video, the encounter seemed friendly at first but when an officer moved to arrest him, Brooks struggled with him and another officer before breaking away across the parking lot with what appeared to be a police Taser in his hand. A video from the restaurant’s cameras showed Brooks turning as he ran and possibly aiming the Taser at the pursuing officers before one of them fired his gun and Brooks fell.   The officer who shot Brooks, Garrett Rolfe, was charged this week with felony murder and ten other counts. The second officer, Devin Brosnan, was charged with lesser counts including aggravated assault and violation of his oath.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Officials in Beijing are carrying out tests to detect traces of coronavirus on all food and parcel delivery workers in an effort to rein in a new outbreak, state-backed media reported on Saturday. Frozen seafood products made of imported shrimps are seen inside a sealed freezer at a supermarket following a new outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Beijing, China June 19, 2020.  REUTERS/Carlos Garcia RawlinsOfficials in the Chinese capital have been expanding nucleic acid testing across the city of 20 million since a cluster of infections linked to a food wholesale market erupted just over a week ago. The outbreak, the first in Beijing in months, has now surpassed previous peak numbers in the city in early February. A nucleic acid test involves a swab sample taken from the back of a person’s throat or respiratory tract, and the sample is then tested for the presence of the coronavirus’ genome.  Testing was initially focused on residential areas near the sprawling Xinfadi market and on people who worked or shopped there.  Officials are now targeting the tens of thousands of delivery personnel who regularly traverse the city, where fleets of motorised pedicabs and scooters ridden by couriers delivering parcels and food are a common sight. Workers at SF Express, China’s second biggest courier firm, arrived in batches at testing points in Beijing on Friday evening, Beijing News reported.  Food delivery firm Meituan Dianping (3690.HK) confirmed that all of its riders in the city would be tested and those who had carried out deliveries in high-risk areas would be temporarily taken off duty, undergo nucleic acid tests and be quarantined at home for 14 days. Customers will be able to view details on disinfection of the delivery package and their courier’s body temperature online, Meituan said on its Wechat account. Beijing News said that all couriers in the city would be tested by next week. Officials have highlighted the risk of contamination through packaging in Beijing, which reported 22 new cases on Friday. The capital has now recorded more than 200 locally transmitted infections since June 11. Officials have been testing people working in catering, including restaurant staff, as well as imported food after the virus was found on chopping boards at Xinfadi used to handle salmon. WHOLE COMMUNITIES TO BE TESTED A total of 2.3 million nucleic acid tests had been carried out in Beijing as of 0600 local time on Saturday (2200 GMT on Friday), Zhang Qiang, an official from Beijing’s municipal committee, said at a news conference. Residents of 40 communities under lockdown in the capital are required to self-isolate at home to avoid possible further transmission of the virus, Zhang said.  Those that do not comply will be centrally quarantined for 14 days, after which they should take another nucleic acid test and are free to leave if the result is negative, he added.  In Dongcheng district in the eastern part of Beijing, two Reuters journalists received notice on Friday that everyone living in their communities would be tested, even though they were in low-risk areas.   Slideshow (2 Images)Dongcheng currently has four neighbourhoods designated as medium-risk, while there are now 34 medium-risk neighbourhoods across the whole city. Mainland China saw 27 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday, with four imported and the other local transmission reported in the northern Hebei province that surrounds Beijing.  There were no new deaths recorded on Friday, leaving the death toll at 4,634.

REUTERS/Leon KuegelerFRANKFURT (Reuters) - More than 1,000 employees at German meat processing firm Toennies have tested positive for coronavirus, prompting local health authorities to order all 6,500 employees and their families to go into quarantine. The localised lockdown is a setback for Germany’s reopening strategy. Chancellor Angela Merkel had favoured maintaining lockdown discipline for longer, but eased restrictions following pressure from regional premiers. Even though its management of the coronavirus crisis has been among the most successful in Europe, Germany has seen repeated outbreaks in slaughterhouses, whose employees are often migrants living in crowded company-provided accommodation. Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, the meat company’s proprietor, Clemens Toennies, said the outbreak presented an “existential crisis” for his firm, which has suspended operations as authorities seek to control the outbreak. “As a company we thought we had done everything right,” Toennies said, adding that his firm had struggled to collect the personal data of employees and contractors so that authorities could trace the outbreak. “As an entrepreneur I can only apologise. We have caused this and are fully responsible for it,” Toennies said.    The outbreak may force the German state of North Rhine Westphalia to impose a broader lockdown. The outbreak near Gutersloh was first reported on Wednesday, when 400 workers tested positive. By Friday, that number had doubled to 803 and it climbed further to 1,029 by Saturday. On Thursday, China banned meat imports from the plant. Reporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by Christina FincherOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain said on Saturday it would allow in British tourists from Sunday without requiring them to spend two weeks in quarantine, opening up to one of its largest tourism markets after the hit from the coronavirus pandemic. FILE PHOTO: Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya reacts during an interview with Reuters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in Madrid, Spain May 28, 2020. REUTERS/Susana VeraBut as much as Spain wants to welcome British tourists, the UK’s current quarantine measures, requiring a two-week period of self-isolation for most people entering the country from abroad, may well put off some potential travellers.  Britain is due to review its 14-day quarantine rule on June 29, three weeks after it was introduced. “We will allow British visitors to enter Spain just like the rest of the European Union or Schengen area from 21 June freely and without the need for the quarantine,” foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya told BBC News. Spain will end its coronavirus state of emergency, imposed  on March 14, on Sunday, and will open its borders to EU and Schengen area countries for a much needed boost to its tourism industry.  Gonzalez Laya said British travellers would be subject to the same “triple check” as other European visitors, which consists of checking their origin, taking their temperature and providing contact details in case they need to be traced.  “We want to make sure we welcome visitors but do so in safety and security for them as well as for Spaniards,” she said.  Spain is still in discussions over whether the UK will similarly lift quarantine measures for Spaniards, she said. But it was opening its borders “out of respect for the 400,000 British citizens who have second residences in Spain” and who are “dying to benefit” from them.  No one from the British government was immediately available for comment.  Britons account for more than a fifth of the roughly 80 million tourists Spain receives every year. Britain, which has reported more more than 42,500 deaths from coronavirus, and Spain, with over 28,300, are among the countries hardest hit by COVID-19. Spain will open its border with Portugal on July 1.  Earlier on Saturday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, in his final weekly televised address before the end of the state of emergency, warned Spaniards not to drop their guard because the virus could return. “Each of us can be a wall in front of the virus or a route of contagion, it depends on each of us,” he said. Spain, which implemented one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns that saw people confined to their homes for nearly two months apart from for trips for food, medicines and essential jobs, has been easing restrictions in recent weeks.

Are they going to have everybody together like we were?” Kiczenski asked. “It’s kind of a different thing for everybody - come to this one and then see how things are going to change going to November.”  Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale told Fox News on Friday that he would probably wear a mask to the rally, while White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told reporters she would not. Trump has eschewed wearing a mask in public. Strategists and former administrations officials say Trump must convince voters that his policies will pull the United States out of the recession sparked by the economic shutdown amid the outbreak.

FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed coronavirus model is seen in front of the words coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on display in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS/Dado RuvicBERLIN (Reuters) - The reproduction rate of the novel coronavirus in Germany has jumped to 1.79 after a raft of localised outbreaks, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health said on Saturday, far above the level needed to contain it over the longer term. The number, a sharp increase from 1.06 on Friday, is a setback for the European Union’s most populous country, which has fared better in the pandemic than many European peers due mainly to early testing and social distancing measures. The institute attributed the rise to a number of local outbreaks, which have been seen in locations such as meatpacking plants, logistics centres, and shelters for refugees. Outbreaks have also been linked to church services and family parties. The premier of the western North Rhine-Westphalia region warned on Friday it faces the threat of a renewed lockdown amid a spiralling outbreak at a major slaughterhouse. “Since case numbers in Germany are generally low, these outbreaks have a relatively strong influence on the value of the reproduction number,” RKI said. “A nationwide increase in case numbers is not anticipated.” When smoothed for short-term effects, the government-affiliated institute estimated the country’s reproduction rate at 1.55, up from 1.17 on Friday. A reproduction rate, or ‘R’, of 1.79 means that 100 people who contracted the virus infect, on average, 179 other people. A rate of less than 1 is needed to gradually contain the disease. Even though its management of the coronavirus crisis has been among the most successful in Europe, Germany has seen repeated outbreaks in slaughterhouses, whose employees are often migrants living in crowded company-provided accommodation. Chancellor Angela Merkel had favoured maintaining lockdown discipline for longer, but Germany eventually eased restrictions following pressure from regional premiers.

TITLE: Ousting of U.S. prosecutor thrusts low-profile markets regulator into unwelcome spotlight
BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Friday’s surprise bid by the U.S. Department of Justice to replace a top federal prosecutor has thrust one of the Trump administration’s more low-profile officials into a partisan storm which he is likely to try to quickly exit, said those who know him. FILE PHOTO: Jay Clayton, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, speaks at the Economic Club of New York luncheon in New York City, New York, U.S.,September 9, 2019. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File PhotoOver the past 12 hours, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton has come under enormous pressure to withdraw his nomination to replace U.S. Attorney in Manhattan Geoffrey Berman after he made it clear he was being ousted. In his post at the Southern District of New York (SDNY), Berman has led the prosecution of high profile corruption and Wall Street crimes, and been investigating President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani. “Clayton can allow himself to be used in the brazen Trump-Barr scheme to interfere in investigations by the U.S. Attorney for SDNY, or he can stand up to this corruption, withdraw his name from consideration, and save his own reputation from overnight ruin,” Schumer tweeted on Saturday. Clayton’s nomination for the SDNY role stunned former SEC officials and industry insiders who have worked with Clayton, a former corporate lawyer and political independent who has steered well clear of partisan controversy during his tenure.  “Given the controversy, I think he will bow out,” said J.W. Verret, a securities law professor at George Mason University who said he knows Clayton from his work on the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee. He described Clayton as “mild-mannered” and said he has “played it straight up the middle” at SEC. While Clayton has been criticized by Democrats and consumer advocates for pushing the Trump administration’s agenda to cut red tape, he is generally respected for his expertise and described by those who deal with him as thoughtful and affable. “He says what he means and he follows through on what he says. And he cares deeply about the American public,” said Scott Bauguess, a University of Texas professor and former SEC official. “It is not clear to me that he is the right person for the SDNY job if the objective is to do the President’s bidding against his own judgment.” Clayton could not be reached for comment on Saturday. His spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  In an email Clayton sent to staff just after midnight on Friday, seen by Reuters, the SEC chair said it was “a great honor to be considered for this important position” and that he remained “fully committed” to SEC work pending his confirmation. Three people with knowledge of Clayton’s thinking said the SEC chair, whose role is based in Washington DC, had been on the lookout for a senior government post based back in New York where he was based prior to joining the SEC. But they and other white collar attorneys who know Clayton said they thought he would no longer want the role now Berman had made it clear he was being ousted. Verret speculated that Clayton may not have had all the facts when agreeing to be nominated. “I really think Clayton is going to do the right thing here … I’ve gotten to know him a bit and I just don’t think he would put up with what appears to be nefarious intent,” he added.

REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A close adviser to former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has begun forming a team to oversee the transition if the Democratic presidential candidate wins November’s election and unseats President Donald Trump, according to a statement on Saturday. Longtime Biden aide Ted Kaufman has recruited six people, including several former Obama administration officials, to an initial team that will later be expanded, a person familiar with the transition team said.  Major party nominees set up transition teams before a general election to coordinate with the incumbent administration.  In a statement, Kaufman said the work would “ensure continuity of government” in the event that Biden must prepare to take over amid the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing economic crisis. “No one will have taken office facing such daunting obstacles since Franklin Delano Roosevelt,” said Kaufman, adding that Biden was ready to begin that work “the day he is sworn in as president.” Kaufman, who filled the U.S. Senate seat for Delaware when Biden became vice president in 2009, co-authored a 2015 law that requires initial transition work to begin six months before an election. Yohannes Abraham, who served in Barack Obama’s White House, will manage the day-to-day operation of the transition team, which is independent of Biden’s presidential campaign. Recruits also include former CIA Deputy Director Avril Haines, another Obama administration alum.

TITLE: UK's Sunak sees 'enormous difference' after social distance review
BODY:
LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Rishi Sunak signalled that the government is poised to relax its two-metre social distancing rule for England which businesses have said in its current form would slow their recovery from the coronavirus lockdown. A review of the two-metre rule would be concluded next week, Sunak told BBC television on Saturday, adding: “Obviously that is something that will make an enormous difference, I think, to many businesses who are keen to see a change.” “Obviously, we need to go through that review but I am very understanding of the calls for action on that.” Many employers, especially in the hospitality and leisure sectors, have said the rule that people must remain two metres apart will stop them from getting back up to speed as the coronavirus lockdown is lifted. Sunak said he understood how the rule was affecting the ability of pubs, restaurants and other hospitality firms to reopen. “I can’t pre-empt the findings of that review but suffice to say we have made really good progress over the past few months in tackling this virus and we all want to see our pubs and our restaurants spring back to life,” he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who announced the review a week ago, has said he will do everything he can to get the country back to normal as soon as possible without risking lives.  The review applies to England as Britain’s devolved nations - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - have their own powers over health rules.      Slideshow (2 Images)Johnson has come under heavy criticism for his handling of the pandemic. Britain has the third highest number of coronavirus deaths after the United States and Brazil. Johnson, who says the government has followed scientific advice in its approach, has to balance the need to revive the economy after its 20% collapse in April without allowing a resurgence in cases.

LONDON (Reuters) - A leader of Black Lives Matter protests in London demanded a meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday and called on him to replace a political adviser chosen to lead a new commission on racial inequality. A demonstrator wearing a protective face mask holds up a placard as she marches during a Black Lives Matter protest, following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, in London, Britain June 20, 2020. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls“I have been here every day, I am the person that leads 20,000 people every protest,” Imarn Ayton, a 29-year-old actress, told Reuters as BLM demonstrators gathered in Hyde Park before their latest march. “Everyone else seems to be in contact with me, except for Boris, so I would like a conversation.” Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated in British cities, as they have in the United States and around the world,  since the death of George Floyd, a Black man, in police custody in Minneapolis last month. Around 2,000 people took part in Saturday’s protest in London, a Reuters reporter estimated. Marchers danced and chanted to the beat of drummers as they made their way to Trafalgar Square via parliament. Demonstrators marched in other British cities including Glasgow where police contained and dispersed a crowd believed to include soccer supporters who posed a risk of causing trouble.  Ayton said BLM demonstrators would continue to protest until the government met their demands.  “It’s that simple. We protest or you listen,” she said. “We want equality - to be treated fairly - that is all that we ask for, and for justice for those who have been harmed.” Ayton said Johnson’s choice as chair of the government’s new commission on inequality, Munira Mirza, a Downing Street adviser, did not represent the BLM movement and did not believe that Britain had a problem with institutional racism. “Munira Mirza must go. She is someone who does not believe in institutional racism, which is exactly why we marched the last two weeks - to abolish institutional racism,” she said. Johnson should act immediately on the recommendations of previous inquiries in Britain into racial inequality, Ayton said, adding that the prime minister had at least heard the voice of the protesters. “I will never know what’s in his heart. What I do know is he has responded. So what I want to do is keep that conversation going,” she said. Johnson’s Downing Street office did not comment on Ayton’s demands.  There were violent clashes in London last weekend after protests by anti-racism supporters and a group made up of military veterans, soccer fans and far-right supporters who said they wanted to protect statues of historical figures from vandalism.

TITLE: Iran may offer discounts to lure airlines to fly through its airspace
BODY:
DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran is drawing up plans to offer discounts to some foreign airlines using its airspace, state news agency IRNA quoted a senior aviation official as saying on Saturday, after a slump in flights due to the coronavirus pandemic and regional tensions. Nasser Aghaei, director of the state-run Iran Airports and Air Navigation Company, said the discounts would go to the top eight airlines providing transit income as well as airlines boosting their flights by 20%. However, no general cut in fees are planned, IRNA said. Iran is one of many countries to charge so-called overflight fees, which are generally used to fund services such as air traffic control, weather data and aeronautical information. The planned discounts still have to be approved by the government, Aghaei said. Before the pandemic, major airlines in January rerouted or cancelled flights to avoid airspace over Iraq and Iran following an Iranian missile strike on U.S.-led forces in Iraq.  On Jan 8, all 176 people aboard a Ukrainian airliner flight were killed when the plane crashed shortly after takeoff en route from Tehran to Kiev. Iran acknowledged shooting the plane down but said it had done so by mistake while under high alert, hours after it had fired at U.S. targets in retaliation for a U.S. strike that killed an Iranian general. In June, some global airlines re-routed flights to avoid Iran-controlled airspace over parts of the Gulf, after the U.S. aviation regulator barred its carriers from the area following the downing of a U.S. drone by Iran.

REUTERS/Leon KuegelerFRANKFURT (Reuters) - More than 1,000 employees at German meat processing firm Toennies have tested positive for coronavirus, prompting local health authorities to order all 6,500 employees and their families to go into quarantine. The localised lockdown is a setback for Germany’s reopening strategy. Chancellor Angela Merkel had favoured maintaining lockdown discipline for longer, but eased restrictions following pressure from regional premiers. Even though its management of the coronavirus crisis has been among the most successful in Europe, Germany has seen repeated outbreaks in slaughterhouses, whose employees are often migrants living in crowded company-provided accommodation. Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, the meat company’s proprietor, Clemens Toennies, said the outbreak presented an “existential crisis” for his firm, which has suspended operations as authorities seek to control the outbreak. “As a company we thought we had done everything right,” Toennies said, adding that his firm had struggled to collect the personal data of employees and contractors so that authorities could trace the outbreak. “As an entrepreneur I can only apologise. We have caused this and are fully responsible for it,” Toennies said.    The outbreak may force the German state of North Rhine Westphalia to impose a broader lockdown. The outbreak near Gutersloh was first reported on Wednesday, when 400 workers tested positive. By Friday, that number had doubled to 803 and it climbed further to 1,029 by Saturday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Saturday denied a request by the Trump administration for an injunction to block publication of a book by President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton that alleges the president sought China’s help to win re-election. FILE PHOTO: Former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton adjusts his glasses during his lecture at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, U.S. February 17, 2020.   REUTERS/Jonathan Drake/File Photo“While Bolton’s unilateral conduct raises grave national security concerns, the government has not established that an injunction is an appropriate remedy,” U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said in his ruling. The administration had sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the publication of “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,” saying it contained classified information and threatened national security. The book, scheduled to hit store shelves on Tuesday, is already in the hands of media organizations. “Defendant Bolton has gambled with the national security of the United States. He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability,” the judge wrote. But he said an injunction would be too late to stem the harm. “With hundreds of thousands of copies around the globe —many in newsrooms — the damage is done,” Lamberth said.In a post on Twitter shortly after the decision, Trump charged again that Bolton was releasing classified information. “He must pay a very big price for this, as others have before him,” Trump said.  He latched on to the judge’s rebuke of Bolton. “BIG COURT WIN against Bolton,” Trump said.  A civil suit is pending against Bolton.  Publishers Simon & Schuster and Bolton’s lawyer Charles Cooper welcomed the ruling. “We respectfully take issue, however, with the Court’s preliminary conclusion at this early stage of the case that Ambassador Bolton did not comply fully with his contractual prepublication obligation to the Government, and the case will now proceed to development of the full record on that issue,” Cooper said in a statement.  Bolton’s book has drawn wide attention for its withering portrayal of Trump. Bolton describes Trump as imploring Chinese President Xi Jinping for help in winning his 2020 re-election bid, and he detailed alleged improprieties not addressed in Trump’s impeachment trial.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Television network HBO Latin America has suspended the TV show of a Mexican comedian who angered President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and his wife with a remark about their child. Chumel Torres, a Mexican comedian, has been at a centre of a  racism row in recent days, which led to a resignation of a government officials who organized a “classism and racism in Mexico” event where Torres was due to speak. Lopez Obrador chastised the officials for inviting Torres to the event, which was cancelled. The president’s wife Beatriz Gutierrez had taken offence to Torres making a joke about her son by calling him “chocoflan,” referring to the dessert which is half black in colour and the other half a lighter hue. HBO Latin America late on Friday said in light of Torres’ social media comments the network was “suspending transmission of CHUMEL CON CHUMEL TORRES until further notice, pending completion of an investigation into these allegations.” Torres has apologised for his remarks but after the event was cancelled on Wednesday said freedom of speech was under threat in Mexico under Lopez Obrador.

TITLE: U.S. prosecutor who has investigated Trump lawyer refuses to resign
BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. federal prosecutor whose office has been investigating President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, refused to step down after the administration abruptly said late on Friday it was replacing him. The standoff marks the latest in a series of unusual actions by Attorney General William Barr that critics say are meant to benefit Trump politically and undermine the independence of the Justice Department.  It also comes as Trump seeks to purge officials perceived as not fully supporting him. In recent weeks he has fired a series of agency watchdogs, including one who played a key role in Trump’s impeachment earlier this year. Barr, in a surprise late-night announcement, said the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, was stepping down and that Trump would nominate Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton to take Berman’s spot. Berman, who leads a powerful office known for prosecuting terrorism cases, Wall Street financial crimes and government corruption, said he first learned of the move from Barr’s press release and would not go quietly. “I have not resigned, and have no intention of resigning my position,” Berman said in a statement. “I will step down when a presidentially appointed nominee is confirmed by the Senate. Until then, our investigations will move forward without delay or interruption.”     A Justice Department official, asked about Berman’s refusal to leave until a successor is confirmed, told Reuters the “timeline remains the same” as Barr laid out in announcing the replacement.  The move seemed to surprise the chairman of the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham, who said on Saturday he had not been contacted by the administration. In a statement, Graham said Clayton’s nomination would still be required to go through the usual practice of getting approvals from his home-state senators, in this case Democrats Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. “As chairman, I have honored that policy and will continue to do so,” Graham said. That approval looked unlikely to be forthcoming, with Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, saying in a statement Clayton should withdraw his name from consideration, “and save his own reputation from overnight ruin.” Gillibrand said in a statement that she would not be complicit in helping Trump and Barr fire a U.S. Attorney who is reportedly investigating corruption in Trump’s administration, and that Clayton should “remove himself from this sham.” FILE PHOTO: U.S. Attorney for the Southern District Geoffrey S.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File PhotoHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, also a Democrat, said he intends to invite Berman to testify. Since being appointed in January 2018, Berman has not shied from taking on figures in Trump’s orbit. His office oversaw the prosecution of Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer, indicted two Giuliani associates and launched a probe into Giuliani in connection with his efforts to dig up dirt on Trump’s political adversaries in Ukraine. Prosecutors have not accused Giuliani of wrongdoing. TIMING QUESTIONED  The move against Berman came as the Justice Department asked a federal court to block publication of a book by former National Security Adviser John Bolton, whose claims include an allegation Trump tried to interfere with a probe overseen by Berman’s office. On Saturday, a U.S. judge denied the administration’s request to block publication. Berman replaced Preet Bharara, who was himself fired as U.S. Attorney in early 2017 soon after Trump became president. Bharara, an outspoken critic of the president, said the timing of the push to replace his successor was strange.  “Why does a president get rid of his own hand-picked US Attorney in SDNY on a Friday night, less than 5 months before the election?” Bharara wrote on Twitter, referring to the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election. Meanwhile, Trump has appointed Craig Carpenito, the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, as the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Barr said in his statement. It was not clear whether Barr can force Berman out. Berman was never confirmed by the Senate, the usual process for appointing U.S. Attorneys, and was instead appointed by the judges of the district in accordance with a U.S. law that says he can serve until the vacancy is filled. Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said the vacancy needs to be filled by someone who is Senate-confirmed or chosen by a judge. Carpenito, Vladeck wrote on Twitter, is neither of those. But Vladeck also cited a conflicting law that gives the president the authority to remove U.S. Attorneys.  Before Clayton joined the SEC, he was a lawyer specializing in mergers and acquisitions at Sullivan & Cromwell. He has been seen as a bipartisan consensus-builder at the SEC. Slideshow (2 Images)The Justice Department official said Clayton, who had been planning to leave the administration and return to New York, “expressed interest” in the U.S. Attorney role in New York, and Barr “thought it was a good idea.” Barr’s announcement comes less than a week before Nadler’s committee is set to hold a hearing where Justice Department officials are set to testify about political interference at the department.  Earlier this year, Barr intervened to scale back the sentencing recommendation for longtime Trump ally Roger Stone, prompting all four career prosecutors to withdraw from the case in protest.

REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko/File PhotoCAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt is committed to using diplomacy to resolve a crisis with Ethiopia over its construction of a giant hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Saturday, addressing stalled talks on the issue. The talks were halted once again on Wednesday, this time only about a fortnight before the expected start-up of the $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is being built near Ethiopia’s border with Sudan and is the centrepiece in its bid to become Africa’s biggest power exporter. Cairo said on Friday it had called on the United Nations Security Council to intervene to restart the talks. “When we moved to the Security Council... that was (because) we are always keen to take the diplomatic and political path until its end,” Sisi said in a speech at an air force base. “We need to move strongly towards concluding the negotiations and reach an agreement... and solutions that achieve the interest of all,” he said. Egypt, which is almost entirely dependent on the Nile for its fresh water supplies, is anxious to secure a legally binding deal that would guarantee minimum flows and a mechanism for resolving disputes before the dam starts operating. The latest talks, which had started on June 9 over video conference, followed a previous round of negotiations in Washington, which ended without agreement in February. On Saturday, Sisi recalled that in a speech he gave to the Ethiopian parliament five years ago he said that while Egypt respects Ethiopians’ need for development they also should respect its needs for “life”. Earlier on Saturday, Sisi ordered his army to be ready to carry out any mission inside or outside the country amid tensions over regional rival Turkey’s intervention in neighbouring Libya.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - West African regional bloc ECOWAS on Saturday called on Mali to re-run some of its contested local elections and convene a government of national unity after anti-government protests swept the capital Bamako.  Supporters of the Imam Mahmoud Dicko attend a protest demanding the resignation of Mali's President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita at Independence Square in Bamako, Mali June 19, 2020. REUTERS/Matthieu RosierTens of thousands of people took to the streets on Friday for the second time in a month to demand President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita step down.  Keita, who was re-elected in 2018 for a second five-year term, has struggled with an ongoing security crisis, a strike by teachers and the coronavirus outbreak.  Political tensions increased after disputed local elections in March in which turnout was low due in part to fears of attacks by jihadist groups who roam the desert north.  The lead-up to the poll was marred by allegations of vote buying and intimidation and the kidnapping of opposition leader Soumaila Cisse. ECOWAS “invites the Government of the Republic of Mali to reconsider the results of all the districts which have been subject to review,” the group said in a statement after a two-day mission to the country. “New elections for the constituencies concerned should be organized as soon as possible.” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged for calm and dialogue after some opposition politicians called for civil disobedience during Friday’s protests. “The Secretary-General calls on all political leaders to send clear messages to their supporters to exercise utmost restraint and to refrain from any action likely to fuel tensions,” said Farhan Haq, a deputy spokesman for Guterres.  Mali, which produces gold and cotton, has struggled to establish stability since 2012 when jihadist fighters hijacked an insurrection by Tuareg separatists, seizing the north. French troops helped to recapture the area but violence persists despite the presence of thousands of U.N. troops, with groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State stoking intercommunal tensions.

ATMEH CAMP, Syria (Reuters) - Four-month-old Abdul Rahman, propped up on pillows on a blue blanket in his family’s tent. Two-year-old Walid, striking a boxer’s pose in the center of the mat. Nine-year-old Ranim, who has never known peace, her bare feet poking out from beneath an embroidered red dress. Nine photos of child refugee for nine years of war. Reuters assigned Syrian photographer Khalil Ashawi to illustrate World Refugee Day, which is on Saturday. He went to the Atmeh camp for displaced people on the Syrian-Turkish border, where families have been sheltering since 2011 from a conflict that has made half of Syrians homeless. He illustrated each of the war’s nine years with a simple picture: a refugee child born in that year. Each poses in a tent, each alone, apart from eight-year-old Jumana and her twin brother Farhan. “Every kid represents a year in the uprising. Every kid narrates a story and they each have their unique story of the war,” Ashawi explained. “These kids don’t know the meaning of a home, some don’t know or have forgotten that a house has a wall and a door.” Slideshow (10 Images)For those children old enough to talk, Ashawi asked each the same question: what is home? Six-year-old Rawan, in a patterned dress, said she still remembers her house “built in the old fashioned way” in south Idlib. “A house for me is a place where my friends and family are. I brought my toys with me but it’s not nice here at all,” she said. “A tent is not a house, because it might catch fire and it might fly with the wind.” Writing by Peter Graff; Editing by Mike Collett-WhiteOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

PARIS (Reuters) - French protesters on Saturday doused the country’s health ministry with red paint, to symbolize the blood of those who died from COVID-19 and to demonstrate against poor working conditions for public sector healthcare workers. “For years, health workers have been alerting us to the fact they don’t have enough resources with regards to staff, beds and equipment to be able to allow us to look after people decently,” Aurelie Trouve, a spokeswoman for the ‘Attac’ activist group which was behind the protest, told Reuters.  They also placed a giant, medal-shaped banner dubbed ‘Medal of Contempt’ on the steps of the French health ministry, to highlight what they said was the government’s failure to listen to the concerns of healthcare workers. President Emmanuel Macron’s government has decided to pay a 1,500 euros ($1,676) bonus to public sector healthcare workers, in recognition of their role during the coronavirus outbreak. Yet many in the sector feel the government should do more for them, and violence broke out this week at another protest held by healthcare workers in Paris.

The country’s death toll since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21 now stands at 34,610, the agency said, the world’s fourth-highest after the United States, Brazil and Britain. The number of confirmed cases amounts to 238,275, the eighth-highest global tally. The agency said a recalculation in the regional count meant two fewer cases were reported in previous days. The number of people registered as currently carrying the illness fell to 21,212 from 21,543 the day before. People in intensive care totalled 152 on Saturday, down from 161 on Friday. Of those originally infected, 182,453 were declared recovered against 181,907 a day earlier.

(Reuters) - Hopes that sport in the United States might soon return to business as usual suffered a blow on Friday as athletes from golf to hockey tested positive for the novel coronavirus, triggering a shutdown of some facilities. FILE PHOTO: Test tube with Corona virus name label is seen in this illustration taken on January 29, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File PhotoThe PGA Tour, which only restarted last week after a three-month COVID-19-forced hiatus, confirmed its first positive test, removing Nick Watney from second-round play at the RBC Heritage in Hilton Head, South Carolina. Over a 24-hour period, Major League Soccer (MLS), National Football League (NFL), National Hockey League (NHL) and Major League Baseball (MLB) confirmed positive tests, and those sports pondered return-to-play scenarios. Leagues are doing extensive testing for coronavirus even among players not showing symptoms. This followed leading U.S. health official Dr. Anthony Fauci on Thursday casting doubt on whether the NFL would get on the field this season. The MLS and NBA were paying particularly close attention to Friday’s events as many of the positive tests occurred in Florida where both leagues have announced plans to restart their seasons at Orlando’s Walt Disney World. Florida is one of several U.S. states where COVID-19 cases have recently surged. The MLS is scheduled to return on July 8 with a World Cup-style tournament featuring all 26 teams. The league, which has said that the health and safety of players and staff were the priority, did not immediately respond to questions about whether the spike in Florida cases would prompt a rethink of those plans.  Inter Miami said on Thursday that one of their players had tested positive for the virus. MLB’s Philadelphia Phillies shut down their Clearwater, Florida, site after five players tested positive while just down the road in Dunedin, the Toronto Blue Jays shuttered training facilities after a player presented symptoms. The San Francisco Giants closed their spring training facility in Scottsdale, Arizona after a visitor and one family member exhibited symptoms. The Giants said they had tested others who have been at the facility and are awaiting results. Los Angeles Angels general manager Billy Eppler said two players had tested positive for COVID-19, but did not disclose if they were on the major league roster, citing medical privacy law, the LA Times reported here  In Tampa, the NHL Lightning closed their arena after three players tested positive. The NHL on Friday said that since June 8, when teams were permitted to open their training facilities, over 200 players have undergone multiple tests and 11 have tested positive. All of the players who tested positive have been self-isolating, the league said.  Even the UFC, who were one of the first sports to resume operations when they staged a mixed martial arts card in Jacksonville, Florida on May 9, are considering another shutdown in wake of the spike. “I told you guys going into this thing, I’m always thinking about what’s next,” said UFC President Dana White in a report by  MMA Junkie. “And I’m planning for a second shutdown, that it will happen again.  “I’m always thinking about the worst.” Reporting by Steve Keating in Toronto, additional reporting Amy Tennery, Rory Carroll and Simon Jennings.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil passed 1 million coronavirus cases on Friday and approached 50,000 deaths, a new nadir for the world’s second worst-hit country as it struggles with a tense political climate and worsening economic outlook. People walk with bags at a popular shopping street amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, June 19, 2020. REUTERS/Amanda PerobelliSecond only to the United States in both cases and deaths, Brazil confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus on Feb. 26. The virus has spread relentlessly across the continent-sized country, eroding support for right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro and raising fears of economic collapse after years of anemic growth. Brazil reported 1,032,913 confirmed cases on Friday, with 1,206 new deaths to take total official fatalities to 48,954, the Health Ministry said. Friday also saw a new record daily number of cases, with 54,771, suggesting the outbreak is far from over. Brazil is likely to surpass 50,000 deaths on Saturday, although weekend reporting can be lower.   Even so, the true extent of the outbreak far exceeds the official figures, according to many experts, who cite a lack of widespread testing. “That number of 1 million is much less than the real number of people who have been infected, because there is under-reporting of a magnitude of five to 10 times,” said Alexandre Naime Barbosa, a medical professor at the São Paulo State University. “The true number is probably at least 3 million and could even be as high as 10 million people.” COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, arrived in Brazil via wealthy tourists returning from Europe to major southeastern cities such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and has spread deep into the interior, reaching 82% of Brazil’s municipalities, Health Ministry data showed.  Bolsonaro, sometimes called the “Tropical Trump,” has been widely criticized for his handling of the crisis. The country still has had no permanent health minister after losing two since April, following clashes with the president. Bolsonaro has shunned social distancing, calling it a job-killing measure more dangerous than the virus itself. He has also promoted two anti-malarial drugs as remedies, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, despite little evidence they work. The far-right former army captain’s handling of the crisis has prompted Brazilians to bang pots and pans regularly outside their apartments in protest, but it has not stopped him from wading into costly political battles with his own cabinet and the Supreme Court, stoking fears of instability. Pressure from Bolsonaro and public fatigue after months of ineffective state and local isolation orders has led governors and mayors to begin lifting restrictions on commerce and other economic activity. Public health experts have warned that loosening restrictions too soon threatens to accelerate contagion and drive up fatalities. Related CoverageBrazil passes 1 million coronavirus cases, nearly 50,000 deaths“We think that there will be a new wave after the loosening of these measures,” said Ricardo Langer, a doctor treating COVID-19 patients at the Maracanã stadium field hospital in Rio de Janeiro. A worsening outbreak could weigh on already-grim economic forecasts. The government has said the economy will contract by 4.7% this year, while economists surveyed by the central bank think it will fall more than 6%. Latin America has registered  90,439 deaths, according to a Reuters tally, with nearly 2 million cases.

REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A close adviser to former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has begun forming a team to oversee the transition if the Democratic presidential candidate wins November’s election and unseats President Donald Trump, according to a statement on Saturday. Longtime Biden aide Ted Kaufman has recruited six people, including several former Obama administration officials, to an initial team that will later be expanded, a person familiar with the transition team said.  Major party nominees set up transition teams before a general election to coordinate with the incumbent administration.  In a statement, Kaufman said the work would “ensure continuity of government” in the event that Biden must prepare to take over amid the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing economic crisis. “No one will have taken office facing such daunting obstacles since Franklin Delano Roosevelt,” said Kaufman, adding that Biden was ready to begin that work “the day he is sworn in as president.” Kaufman, who filled the U.S. Senate seat for Delaware when Biden became vice president in 2009, co-authored a 2015 law that requires initial transition work to begin six months before an election. Yohannes Abraham, who served in Barack Obama’s White House, will manage the day-to-day operation of the transition team, which is independent of Biden’s presidential campaign. Recruits also include former CIA Deputy Director Avril Haines, another Obama administration alum.

LONDON (Reuters) - A leader of Black Lives Matter protests in London demanded a meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday and called on him to replace a political adviser chosen to lead a new commission on racial inequality. A demonstrator wearing a protective face mask holds up a placard as she marches during a Black Lives Matter protest, following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, in London, Britain June 20, 2020. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls“I have been here every day, I am the person that leads 20,000 people every protest,” Imarn Ayton, a 29-year-old actress, told Reuters as BLM demonstrators gathered in Hyde Park before their latest march. “Everyone else seems to be in contact with me, except for Boris, so I would like a conversation.” Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated in British cities, as they have in the United States and around the world,  since the death of George Floyd, a Black man, in police custody in Minneapolis last month. Around 2,000 people took part in Saturday’s protest in London, a Reuters reporter estimated. Marchers danced and chanted to the beat of drummers as they made their way to Trafalgar Square via parliament. Demonstrators marched in other British cities including Glasgow where police contained and dispersed a crowd believed to include soccer supporters who posed a risk of causing trouble.  Ayton said BLM demonstrators would continue to protest until the government met their demands.  “It’s that simple. We protest or you listen,” she said. “We want equality - to be treated fairly - that is all that we ask for, and for justice for those who have been harmed.” Ayton said Johnson’s choice as chair of the government’s new commission on inequality, Munira Mirza, a Downing Street adviser, did not represent the BLM movement and did not believe that Britain had a problem with institutional racism. “Munira Mirza must go. She is someone who does not believe in institutional racism, which is exactly why we marched the last two weeks - to abolish institutional racism,” she said. Johnson should act immediately on the recommendations of previous inquiries in Britain into racial inequality, Ayton said, adding that the prime minister had at least heard the voice of the protesters. “I will never know what’s in his heart. What I do know is he has responded. So what I want to do is keep that conversation going,” she said. Johnson’s Downing Street office did not comment on Ayton’s demands.  There were violent clashes in London last weekend after protests by anti-racism supporters and a group made up of military veterans, soccer fans and far-right supporters who said they wanted to protect statues of historical figures from vandalism.

NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVES.Fighting on the two countries’ Himalayan frontier on Monday killed at least 20 Indian soldiers and injured more than 70. China has not released any casualty figures for its troops.   While Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to downplay the clash on Friday, his government a day later blamed China for seeking to erect structures “just across the Line of Actual Control”, as the demarcation is known, and refusing India’s request to stop. India will not allow any unilateral changes to the disputed border, it said in a statement.  Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused Indian troops of a “deliberate provocation” in the tense Himalayan area. In a series of tweets, Zhao said the Galwan Valley was on the Chinese side of the line and that Indians had since April unilaterally built roads, bridges and other facilities in the region. The Indian troops “crossed the Line of Actual Control” and attacked Chinese officers and soldiers who were there for negotiation, triggering “fierce physical conflicts”, Zhao said. India’s foreign ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava denied any violation of the Line of Actual Control by India, and said the claims by the Chinese side were “not acceptable”. “We do not accept the contention that India was unilaterally changing the status quo. On the contrary, we were maintaining it,” Srivastava said.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticised China for escalating border tensions with India.  “The PLA (China’s People’s Liberation Army) has escalated border tensions – we see it today in India...  and we watch as it militarizes the South China Sea and illegally claims more territory there,” Pompeo said in at the virtual Copenhagen Democracy Summit. Troops remain locked in a face-off at several locations along the poorly defined Line of Actual Control, despite talks between local commanders to de-escalate. Modi on Friday appeared to downplay the clash with Chinese troops, saying: “Nobody has intruded into our border, neither is anybody there now, nor have our posts been captured.” Reporting by Aftab Ahmed in New Delhi and Tom Daly in Beijing; Editing by William Mallard and Jan HarveyOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

REUTERS/Evan SemonBy Keith Coffman DENVER (Reuters) - Colorado Governor Jared Polis on Friday signed into law a bill to remove the shield of legal immunity that has long protected police officers from civil suits for on-the-job misconduct, a measure civil libertarians hailed as landmark legislation. The Colorado state legislature passed the sweeping police accountability bill last week in the wake of nationwide protests over unfair treatment of racial minorities by law enforcement, sparked by the death of an unarmed Black man under the knee of a white Minneapolis policeman last month.     Polis, a first-term Democrat, took the 155th anniversary of Juneteenth, celebrating the abolition of slavery in the United States, to formally enact the law. The American Civil Liberties Union hailed enactment of the measure, saying Colorado became one of the first states in the nation to strip police officers of a legal defense known as qualified immunity. The ACLU called the police accountability law as a whole historic. The statute additionally requires police agencies statewide to adopt the use of body-worn cameras by their officers within three years, and bans choke holds by officers in restraining individuals.  Carotid-pressure holds, similar to the technique that Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin used when he knelt on the neck of George Floyd in a fatal encounter on May 25, is also outlawed. The legislation won the support from the state’s police chiefs and county sheriffs’ organizations, which said in a joint written statement that many of the policies contained in the new law are already in place at the local level. The U.S. Supreme Court recognized qualified immunity 50 years ago to protect government officials from frivolous lawsuits. Attorneys representing police have said the doctrine ensures officers can make split-second decisions in dangerous situations without worrying about being sued later. Critics have said the doctrine too often lets police brutality go unpunished. The high court this week declined to hear several cases challenging qualified immunity assertions on behalf of police.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain said on Saturday it would allow in British tourists from Sunday without requiring them to spend two weeks in quarantine, opening up to one of its largest tourism markets after the hit from the coronavirus pandemic. FILE PHOTO: Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya reacts during an interview with Reuters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in Madrid, Spain May 28, 2020. REUTERS/Susana VeraBut as much as Spain wants to welcome British tourists, the UK’s current quarantine measures, requiring a two-week period of self-isolation for most people entering the country from abroad, may well put off some potential travellers.  Britain is due to review its 14-day quarantine rule on June 29, three weeks after it was introduced. “We will allow British visitors to enter Spain just like the rest of the European Union or Schengen area from 21 June freely and without the need for the quarantine,” foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya told BBC News. Spain will end its coronavirus state of emergency, imposed  on March 14, on Sunday, and will open its borders to EU and Schengen area countries for a much needed boost to its tourism industry.  Gonzalez Laya said British travellers would be subject to the same “triple check” as other European visitors, which consists of checking their origin, taking their temperature and providing contact details in case they need to be traced.  “We want to make sure we welcome visitors but do so in safety and security for them as well as for Spaniards,” she said.  Spain is still in discussions over whether the UK will similarly lift quarantine measures for Spaniards, she said. But it was opening its borders “out of respect for the 400,000 British citizens who have second residences in Spain” and who are “dying to benefit” from them.  No one from the British government was immediately available for comment.  Britons account for more than a fifth of the roughly 80 million tourists Spain receives every year. Britain, which has reported more more than 42,500 deaths from coronavirus, and Spain, with over 28,300, are among the countries hardest hit by COVID-19. Spain will open its border with Portugal on July 1.  Earlier on Saturday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, in his final weekly televised address before the end of the state of emergency, warned Spaniards not to drop their guard because the virus could return. “Each of us can be a wall in front of the virus or a route of contagion, it depends on each of us,” he said. Spain, which implemented one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns that saw people confined to their homes for nearly two months apart from for trips for food, medicines and essential jobs, has been easing restrictions in recent weeks.

[nL8N2DW1AG] “The downgrade of Wirecard’s ratings and review for further downgrade reflect the accounting irregularities and related implications on the company’s liquidity and financial profile following its failure to publish the already postponed audited consolidated accounts for 2019,” Moody’s said late on Friday. Wirecard, once seen as one of the hottest financial technology investments in Europe, faces a cash crunch after admitting it may have been the victim of fraud. [nASN0008BC] The company’s auditors refused to sign off on its 2019 earnings report, a step that could trigger high and immediate refinancing needs, according to analysts who cover the firm. Following the resignation of Markus Braun as chief executive, Wirecard said in a statement late on Friday that it had hired Houlihan Lokey to overhaul its financing strategy. Analysts said banks could move to call in some two billion euros in loans granted to the firm. “The deadline for audited results was June 19, yesterday, otherwise 2 billion euros of loans could be terminated,” said Neil Campling, an analyst at the Geneva-based Mirabaud asset-management company. FALSE DOCUMENTS Wirecard’s troubles deepened after two Philippine lenders, BPI and BDO, said documents purporting to show the company had deposited funds with the banks were false. BPI told Reuters on Saturday that it had suspended an assistant manager whose signature appeared on one of the fraudulent documents. “It was a letter supposedly signed by the assistant manager implying that we had banking relationships with Wirecard. Which is not the case,” the bank said. The other bank, BDO, told the Philippine central bank that it appeared one of its marketing officers had fabricated a bank certificate. Philippine Central Bank Governor Benjamin Diokno told Reuters the fact that the documents were fake was confirmed following questions raised by EY, Wirecard’s external auditor, which is under fire from the payments firm’s shareholders. BDO Chief Executive Nestor Tan also said EY had approached them to ask whether Wirecard was a client.  Wirecard said on June 18 that auditors had suddenly refused to accept the certificates confirming account balances, angering leading investors as nearly 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) was wiped off the company’s market value in two days. Dutch shareholder group VEB said on Friday it would seek compensation from EY because it had failed to warn investors earlier. “EY has played a significant role in the whole Wirecard scandal, not only from its inability to detect the flaws in Wirecard’s escrow account in former years,” VEB said.  “Just when EY should have played a protective and clarifying role, it left the shareholders out in the cold,” it added.  A spokeswoman for EY in London said on Saturday it had not received news of VEB’s complaint and declined further comment. VEB has said Braun told investors on May 3 that EY had reassured the company they had no problem signing off on the 2019 audit. That wrong-footed the markets, leading shareholders to incur losses, according to VEB. Wirecard shares closed down 35% on Friday after the firm said it could not issue audited financial results.

TITLE: Wall Street Week Ahead: London index reshuffle to give healthcare stocks a bigger profile
BODY:
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. healthcare sector looks set for a bulked up profile in growth indexes when FTSE Russell reconstitutes its stock indexes late next Friday, an annual event that historically creates one of the biggest trading volume days of the year.  FILE PHOTO: The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is seen in the financial district of lower Manhattan during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in New York City, U.S., April 26, 2020. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon/File PhotoThe Russell rebalance becomes final on the fourth Friday every June, after markets close. Stocks are added or deleted from Russell’s family of indexes, including the Russell 1000 large cap and Russell 2000 small cap, prompting fund managers to adjust portfolios to reflect new weightings and components. Russell bases the placesment in the indexes on a number of factors, including market capitalization, voting rights requirements and country of domicile.  Telegraphing the reconstitution can create additional buying and selling stocks. Some investors may use the additional liquidity to take advantage of any resulting price dislocations, or to adjust the holdings in their portfolios, especially in smaller companies that have much lower liquidity.  The resulting surge in trading volume crests right before the market close. FTSE Russell says more than $15 trillion is currently benchmarked to its indexes globally and about $9 trillion to its U.S. indexes. “I’m already at the spot where I will be happy when Russell is behind us because it is an emotionally elevated day, everybody has to really be on their toes, there is a lot of messages and a lot of traffic coming down,” said Gordon Charlop, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York.  The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, because of the scale of the revamp, reinforces the rules for trades on the close and contingency plans in the event of unusual market conditions. During the June 2019 reconstitution, Nasdaq said 1.279 billion shares representing $42.59 billion were executed in its “closing cross” in 1.14 seconds across Nasdaq listed stocks. This year’s reconstitution is also influenced by market volatility generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. While other index providers delayed rebalancing that was scheduled for earlier in the year, FTSE Russell has moved forward with the reconstitution as originally scheduled.  “Our policy team did consult the market on whether any temporary measures were needed to accommodate the market volatility and the overwhelming feedback was that it wasn’t required and we should proceed according to the published rules,” said Catherine Yoshimoto, director, product management at FTSE Russell. The influence of the novel coronavirus will also create more movement between the indexes than in recent years. Virtu Financial estimates turnover across the Russell 3000 to be $57 billion compared with the $35 billion last year.  In addition, the coronavirus has aided the strong performance of healthcare stocks and other names that have benefited from the “stay at home” environment, some of which are likely to be added directly, or promoted to, the large cap Russell 1000.  Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. Equity Strategy at RBC Capital Markets anticipates nearly half of the stocks being promoted to the Russell 1000 from the Russell 2000 will be healthcare names.  Teladoc, which offers virtual healthcare services, has risen more than 130% this year and is widely expected to be promoted to the Russell large cap index. Home fitness provider Peloton is seen as being added directly to the Russell 1000. Of the six initial public offerings being added to the Russell 2000, all belong to the healthcare space.  Jefferies anticipates the healthcare weight in the Russell 2000 to decrease by 1.7% as a result of these promotions, while forecasting the healthcare weight in the Russell 2000 growth index at 33%, with 17% due to biotech names.   The firm sees the weighting for healthcare increasing by 5.9% in the Russell Midcap growth index and 1% in the Russell 1000 growth index. “Obviously healthcare is the cure to this pandemic, so anything and everything in healthcare has generally worked pretty well,” said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York. “There are so many companies that are trying stuff. Who knows who is going to win or lose out of this?”      Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; additional reporting by John McCrank; Editing by Alden BentleyOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

BODY:
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan’s export orders edged up for a third consecutive month in May, thanks to sustained demand for telecommuting products like laptops during the coronavirus pandemic that has forced millions of people globally to work at home. A person drives a motorcycle by shipping containers at a port in Keelung, Taiwan, June 10, 2020. REUTERS/Ann WangExport orders for Taiwan, seen as a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 0.4% from a year earlier to $38.9 billion, Ministry of Economic Affairs data showed on Saturday. The uptick, however, lagged a Reuters poll estimate for a 1.1% rise compared with 2.3% growth in April. The ministry, which has repeatedly cautioned of a difficult outlook for Taiwan’s orders due to the coronavirus impact, said the May numbers were helped by “flourishing” demand for equipment from people working from home. Looking ahead, the outlook was brighter with the pandemic abating in Europe and the United States and economic activity gradually resuming around the world, it added. However, it cautioned that uncertainties from the pandemic, as well as China-U.S. trade tensions, could still harm Taiwan’s export. The ministry said it expects June export orders to be in a range of 0% growth to a 3.9% rise from a year earlier. Taiwan’s manufacturers, a key part of the global supply chain for tech giants such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Huawei Technologies, have been hit hard by faltering global demand for electronics in the wake of containment measures and lockdowns in many countries. May orders from the United States rose 8.6% from a year earlier, compared with 6.8% growth in April, while those from China were up 2.7% versus a 9.2% gain the previous month. European orders rose 12.3% but were down 8.1% from Japan. Taiwan’s economic growth slowed to its weakest in nearly four years in the first quarter as the pandemic crimped domestic consumption and tourism. In response, the government has stepped up support measures, and is rolling out a stimulus package it expects will eventually be worth T$1.05 trillion ($35.01 billion).

BODY:
CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - The New Development Bank established by the BRICS group of emerging nations has approved a $1 billion COVID-19 emergency loan to South Africa to help reduce the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic, the National Treasury said on Saturday. South Africa was already in recession before the pandemic wreaked further havoc in Africa’s most industrialized economy. “The COVID-19 emergency program loan to South Africa will be provided in response to the urgent request and immediate financing needs of the South African government,” the Treasury said in a statement. Finance minister Tito Mboweni is expected to unveil an emergency budget with major changes to spending and revenue forecasts in parliament on Wednesday. The government this week further relaxed two months of tough restrictions as it looks to support the economy. After detecting its first case in March, infections and deaths have spread across South Africa. As of Friday the country had 87,715 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,831 deaths.

FILE PHOTO: Reporters raise their hands for a question during a news conference by Toshiba Corp CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa (not in picture) at the company headquarters in Tokyo, Japan June 23, 2017.  REUTERS/Issei Kato TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp (6502.T) plans to gradually unwind its 40% stake in Kioxia Holdings after the world’s second-largest flash memory chip firm lists its shares in an IPO later this year, two people familiar with the matter said on Saturday. The Japanese industrial conglomerate is considering  distributing about half or more of after-tax proceeds from the sale back to shareholders, the sources told Reuters, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Toshiba said in a filing with the Tokyo stock exchange on Saturday that it was considering various possibilities for shareholder returns, such as the handling of assets and reviewing its portfolio. The company said nothing has been decided over its stake in Kioxia, the former flash memory chips unit it sold to a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital for $18 billion in 2018.  Toshiba bought its Kioxia stake as part of that deal. The initial public offering of Kioxia could be Japan’s biggest listing this year, sources have said. Japanese media reports have estimated market valuation to reach $32 billion in an IPO as early as October, although the coronavirus outbreak has created uncertainty over the timing and valuation of the IPO. Many overseas fund investors are urging Toshiba to sell the stake on the grounds that flash memory chips, used in smartphones and data storage servers, are a highly volatile business that could sway Toshiba’s earnings, the source said. Toshiba has been facing pressure from activist funds agitating for changes since the company sold 600 billion yen  ($5.6 billion) of stock to dozens of foreign hedge funds during a crisis stemming from the bankruptcy of the U.S. nuclear power unit in 2017. Nearly 70% of its shareholders are non-Japanese.

BODY:
FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed coronavirus model is seen in front of the words coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on display in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS/Dado RuvicBERLIN (Reuters) - The reproduction rate of the novel coronavirus in Germany has jumped to 1.79 after a raft of localised outbreaks, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health said on Saturday, far above the level needed to contain it over the longer term. The number, a sharp increase from 1.06 on Friday, is a setback for the European Union’s most populous country, which has fared better in the pandemic than many European peers due mainly to early testing and social distancing measures. The institute attributed the rise to a number of local outbreaks, which have been seen in locations such as meatpacking plants, logistics centres, and shelters for refugees. Outbreaks have also been linked to church services and family parties. The premier of the western North Rhine-Westphalia region warned on Friday it faces the threat of a renewed lockdown amid a spiralling outbreak at a major slaughterhouse. “Since case numbers in Germany are generally low, these outbreaks have a relatively strong influence on the value of the reproduction number,” RKI said. “A nationwide increase in case numbers is not anticipated.” When smoothed for short-term effects, the government-affiliated institute estimated the country’s reproduction rate at 1.55, up from 1.17 on Friday. A reproduction rate, or ‘R’, of 1.79 means that 100 people who contracted the virus infect, on average, 179 other people. A rate of less than 1 is needed to gradually contain the disease. Even though its management of the coronavirus crisis has been among the most successful in Europe, Germany has seen repeated outbreaks in slaughterhouses, whose employees are often migrants living in crowded company-provided accommodation. Chancellor Angela Merkel had favoured maintaining lockdown discipline for longer, but Germany eventually eased restrictions following pressure from regional premiers.

TITLE: UK's Sunak sees 'enormous difference' after social distance review
BODY:
LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Rishi Sunak signalled that the government is poised to relax its two-metre social distancing rule for England which businesses have said in its current form would slow their recovery from the coronavirus lockdown. A review of the two-metre rule would be concluded next week, Sunak told BBC television on Saturday, adding: “Obviously that is something that will make an enormous difference, I think, to many businesses who are keen to see a change.” “Obviously, we need to go through that review but I am very understanding of the calls for action on that.” Many employers, especially in the hospitality and leisure sectors, have said the rule that people must remain two metres apart will stop them from getting back up to speed as the coronavirus lockdown is lifted. Sunak said he understood how the rule was affecting the ability of pubs, restaurants and other hospitality firms to reopen. “I can’t pre-empt the findings of that review but suffice to say we have made really good progress over the past few months in tackling this virus and we all want to see our pubs and our restaurants spring back to life,” he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who announced the review a week ago, has said he will do everything he can to get the country back to normal as soon as possible without risking lives.  The review applies to England as Britain’s devolved nations - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - have their own powers over health rules.      Slideshow (2 Images)Johnson has come under heavy criticism for his handling of the pandemic. Britain has the third highest number of coronavirus deaths after the United States and Brazil. Johnson, who says the government has followed scientific advice in its approach, has to balance the need to revive the economy after its 20% collapse in April without allowing a resurgence in cases. Britain’s retail sector has already been allowed to re-open. Writing by William Schomberg; Editing by Jason Neely and Frances KerryOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

TITLE: Iran may offer discounts to lure airlines to fly through its airspace
BODY:
DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran is drawing up plans to offer discounts to some foreign airlines using its airspace, state news agency IRNA quoted a senior aviation official as saying on Saturday, after a slump in flights due to the coronavirus pandemic and regional tensions. Nasser Aghaei, director of the state-run Iran Airports and Air Navigation Company, said the discounts would go to the top eight airlines providing transit income as well as airlines boosting their flights by 20%. However, no general cut in fees are planned, IRNA said. Iran is one of many countries to charge so-called overflight fees, which are generally used to fund services such as air traffic control, weather data and aeronautical information. The planned discounts still have to be approved by the government, Aghaei said. Before the pandemic, major airlines in January rerouted or cancelled flights to avoid airspace over Iraq and Iran following an Iranian missile strike on U.S.-led forces in Iraq.  On Jan 8, all 176 people aboard a Ukrainian airliner flight were killed when the plane crashed shortly after takeoff en route from Tehran to Kiev. Iran acknowledged shooting the plane down but said it had done so by mistake while under high alert, hours after it had fired at U.S. targets in retaliation for a U.S. strike that killed an Iranian general. In June, some global airlines re-routed flights to avoid Iran-controlled airspace over parts of the Gulf, after the U.S. aviation regulator barred its carriers from the area following the downing of a U.S. drone by Iran.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) has secured clearance to deliver alcohol in India’s eastern state of West Bengal, according to a document seen by Reuters, signalling the U.S. e-commerce giant’s first foray into the country’s multi-billion-dollar sector.

Alibaba-backed (BABA.N) Indian grocery venture BigBasket has also won approval to deliver alcohol in the state, the notice said.  West Bengal is India’s fourth most populous state, with a population of more than 90 million people. Amazon has been invited to sign a memorandum of understanding with the state, said the notice, which has not previously been reported. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. BigBasket also did not respond to a request for comment. Amazon’s interest in delivering alcohol in West Bengal marks a bold move to make inroads into a market that is worth $27.2 billion, according to estimates by IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. Over the years, Amazon has expanded its e-commere operations in India as more and more people go online to shop for everything from groceries to electronics. The company has committed $6.5 billion in investments in India, one of its key growth markets. India’s top two food-delivery startups, Swiggy and Zomato, started delivering alcohol in some cities last month, as they looked to cash in on the high demand for booze as many states come out of a lockdown aimed at tackling the coronavirus. India restricted liquor sales when it announced a nationwide lockdown in March. Hundreds of people queued up at liquor stores in May when some restrictions were eased, and the liquor industry had been lobbying with many states to allow online deliveries. Each state sets its own alcohol sales policy. West Bengal last month invited companies to express interest for “handling electronic ordering, purchase, sale and home delivery of alcoholic liquors from licensed retail outlets” to eligible legal-age consumers in the state.

BODY:
LONDON (Reuters) - British security officials have told UK telecom operators to ensure they have adequate stockpiles of Huawei equipment due to fears that new U.S. sanctions will disrupt the Chinese firm’s ability to maintain critical supplies, according to a letter seen by Reuters. FILE PHOTO: The British flag and a smartphone with a Huawei and 5G network logo are seen on a PC motherboard in this illustration picture taken January 29, 2020. REUTERS/Dado RuvicBritain granted Huawei a limited role in its future 5G networks in January, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has since come under renewed pressure from Washington and some lawmakers in his own party who say the company’s equipment is a security risk. Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations. Officials at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) are now studying the impact of U.S. measures announced in May, which are intended to restrict Huawei’s ability to source the advanced microchips needed to produce its 5G equipment and flagship smartphones.  Senior NCSC officials wrote to operators including Britain’s BT Group and Vodafone last week, said three people familiar with the matter, telling them to maintain adequate supplies of spare parts from all manufacturers. But the letter also emphasised the increased risk to Huawei’s equipment and its future ability to provide updates for those products in the face of U.S. pressure. “Ensuring that products and components are kept up-to-date is essential to maintaining the security of networks,” the letter said. “Escalating U.S. action against Huawei may affect its ability to provide updates for products containing U.S. technology.” An NCSC spokeswoman said: “The NCSC has provided operators with a series of precautionary steps we recommend they take while we carefully consider the impact these sanctions have on the UK’s networks.” Huawei Vice President Victor Zhang said: “Our customers are our number one priority and we are working with them to ensure business continuity. We strongly oppose politically-motivated actions by the US that are designed to damage our business and are not based on evidence.” BT and Vodafone declined to comment.  Britain designated Huawei a “high-risk vendor” in January, capping its 5G involvement at a 35% market share and excluding it from the data-heavy core of the network.  Officials now say they are reviewing the specific guidance on how Huawei equipment should be deployed in order to best secure UK networks and are considering a range of options. A decision is due in the coming weeks. Any move by London to further restrict Huawei or bar the company completely would strain relations with China, which have grown tense in recent months over Beijing’s handling of the situation in Hong Kong and the COVID-19 pandemic.

REUTERS/Tom Brenner/File PhotoWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee (RNC) raised $74 million in May, Trump’s re-election campaign announced on Saturday, short of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s haul of for the month. Trump’s fundraising, up from $61.7 million in April, comes as the president is set to hold his first major campaign event since the coronavirus pandemic shut down most campaigning with a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday.   Former Vice President Biden and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) raised $80.8 million in May, their largest single month of fundraising. The Trump campaign and the RNC hold a massive cash advantage over Biden ahead of the Nov. 3 election, however, amassing a total of $817 million in three years of fundraising, according to a statement. The Trump campaign and RNC’s joint fundraising committees had $265 million in cash on hand, and recently hired 300 new staff in “target states,” it said.  Trump’s fundraising has regularly outstripped Biden’s presidential campaign, which was only launched in April last year and fought a competitive Democratic primary campaign. But since becoming the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee in April, Biden has built a lead over Trump in national opinion polls, amid the twin crises of the coronavirus pandemic and civil unrest over police brutality in many U.S. cities. Biden announced his first major advertising blitz on this week, launching $15 million in TV and digital ads in the crucial states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida and North Carolina, all states Trump won in 2016.

TITLE: Trump warns protesters to face 'different scene' at his Oklahoma rally
BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday threatened unspecified action against any protesters at his weekend re-election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in a warning that his campaign said was not directed at peaceful demonstrators. “Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene!” Trump wrote on Twitter. Marc Lotter, a spokesman for Trump’s campaign, said Trump was referring to agitators and not peaceful protesters.  “The president supports peaceful protests and people who are exercising their First Amendment rights,” Lotter told MSNBC in an interview following the tweet. “If we see what we’ve seen in other cities with rioting, looting, setting buildings on fire and physical violence, then that’s going to be something that’s going to be met by police.” White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at a briefing that earlier destructive protests were unacceptable while peaceful demonstrators would be allowed: “What he was meaning are violent protesters, anarchists, looters - the kind of lawlessness we saw before.” The rally is Trump’s first major re-election event following the novel coronavirus pandemic that shuttered much of the country and comes amid weeks of civil unrest over the treatment of African Americans and growing protests over racism and policing.  With more than 100,000 people expected in the area of the rally on Saturday, Tulsa mayor G.T. Bynum on Friday rescinded a curfew he had ordered for several downtown city blocks around the venue. “Today, the Secret Service asked the City to lift the curfew order this weekend. In compliance with this request, the City has rescinded the order,” the city of Tulsa said in a press release quoted by CBS News. Trump thanked Bynum in a tweet for canceling the curfew. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S., March 2, 2020.  REUTERS/Lucas JacksonThe Republican president faced backlash over a tweet during protests after the recent death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, an African American man, that said “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The phrase evoked a white segregationist who was Miami mayor in the 1960s, though Trump later said he was unaware of its origins. The Rev. Al Sharpton, a veteran civil rights activist set to address a Juneteenth event in Tulsa later on Friday, called Trump’s tweet “disrespectful,” especially following the recent deaths of Floyd and another African American man, Rayshard Brooks, in Atlanta. “To have a threat like that you’re provoking an incident, and you’re provoking an interaction that is unnecessary,” Sharpton told MSNBC.

REUTERS/Maxim ShemetovWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Special Presidential Envoy Marshall Billingslea will travel to Austria on Monday and Tuesday to discuss “mutually agreed topics related to the future of arms control” with Russian Deputy Foreign Sergei Ryabkov, the U.S. State Department said on Friday. “The United States has extended an open invitation to the People’s Republic of China to join these discussions, and has made clear the need for all three countries to pursue arms control negotiations in good faith,” the State Department said. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for China to join the United States and Russia in talks on a nuclear arms control agreement to replace the 2010 New START accord. New START, which imposes the last remaining limits on U.S. and Russian deployments of strategic nuclear arms to no more than 1,550 each, expires in February.  China, estimated to have about 300 nuclear weapons, has repeatedly rejected Trump’s proposal. Billingslea had said last week that he had agreed with Ryabkov on a time and place for the negotiations in June.

TITLE: Hungary's MKB Bank eyes stake in Croatia's Slatinska Banka
BODY:
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary’s MKB Bank [BLGGM.UL] said on Friday it was considering acquiring a stake in Croatia’s Slatinska Banka SNBA.ZA. MKB, which is emerging from a European Union restructuring process that had barred it from takeovers, did not specify the size of stake it was looking at. Slatinska Banka had total assets worth 1.57 billion Croatian kuna ($231.95 million) at the end of 2018, based on data from the Croatian National Bank. It earned a profit of 4.78 million kuna in 2018 based on central bank figures. Its main shareholders at the end of 2018 were SZAIF dd. SLPF.ZA, a Croatia-based closed-end investment fund with a 24% stake, while the Republic of Croatia had an 8.24% stake. MKB, Hungary’s eighth-largest lender by 2018 assets, recently formed an alliance with savings and loans group Takarek and state-owned Budapest Bank to explore a possible merger that would create Hungary’s No.2 banking group.

BODY:
MILANO (Reuters) - Italian utilities HERA (HRA.MI), Iren (IREE.MI) and Dolomiti Energia together with Alperia have submitted bids for minority stakes in the company that will result from the planned merger of rivals AIM Vicenza and AGSM Verona, a source close to the matter said on Friday. The source said the potential investors in the new group were also proposing a broader industrial partnership with AIM Vicenza and AGSM Verona. Hera declined to comment, while the other utilities could not immediately be reached for comment.  The bids could hamper plans by Italy’s biggest northern utility A2A A2.M to strike a partnerships with the new group by the end of June. Some months ago, A2A had put forward its own proposal to the cities of Vicenza and Verona, which are the main shareholders in AIM Vicenza and AGSM Verona, respectively.

REUTERS/Chris HelgrenBRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have suspended their investigation into Air Canada’s (AC.TO) bid for Canadian tour operator and carrier Transat AT Inc (TRZ.TO) while waiting for the companies to provide data sought by the enforcers. The European Commission, which opened a four-month investigation last month on concerns that the deal may result in higher prices and less choice for flights between Europe and Canada, halted its probe Thursday. “This procedure in merger investigations is activated if the parties fail to provide, in a timely fashion, an important piece of information that the Commission has requested from them,” the EU executive said. “Once the missing information is supplied by the parties, the clock is re-started and the deadline for the Commission’s decision is then adjusted accordingly,” it said. It had previously set a Sept. 30 deadline for its decision. Transat has said it expects to close the deal in the fourth quarter of the year.
